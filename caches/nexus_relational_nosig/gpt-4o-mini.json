Make sure to include all functions.\n</functions>\n\nThen, add addition, notes, clarifications, or instructions on how to operate the environment for future reference.\n\nPlease structure your outputs as follows:\n\n<additional_information>\n   Any clarifications, learnings, guides etc. Focus on how to interact with the environment. Explain to a future agent put in the same enviornment how they might go about answering user queries sent to the environment. The future agent will also only be able to submit functions in the <function_list> tags and recieve environment feedback.\n</additional_information>\n\nThen, if helpful, add some few-shot examples of potential use cases that may help for future reference.\n\nPlease structure your outputs as follows:\n\n<examples>\n   Give reasonable example user queries on the enviornment. Then show can they can be answered step by step through calling functions in the environment, in the same way you have done so above. Be detailed on the process and reasoning.\n</examples>\n\nBetween the updated functions, additional information, and examples, a future agent should be able to smoothly navigate this functional environment without undergoing this full exploration procedure. Make sure the information gained here is passed on through these fields.",

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n</additional_information>\n\n<examples>\n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n</examples>",

  "additional_information": "\nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Each function has a specific return type, which is crucial for interpreting the results. Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n",

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n</additional_information>\n\n<examples>\n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n</examples>"

Familiarize yourself with the expected output types to interpret results correctly.\n\n2. **Exploring User Preferences**: When investigating user preferences, consider checking favorite foods, colors, and any potential allergies. This can help in understanding dietary restrictions or preferences.\n\n3. **Location Context**: When dealing with food or weather, always consider the user's location. This can influence food availability and meal choices.\n\n4. **Iterative Exploration**: If a function's output raises further questions, don't hesitate to call additional functions to gather more information. For example, if a user has a favorite food, check its calorie count and allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: While the environment does not explicitly mention error cases, be cautious with invalid IDs or names. If a function call does not return expected results, consider verifying the input values.\n\n6. **Documenting Findings**: Keep track of any interesting findings or patterns you observe during your exploration. This can help in answering user queries more effectively in the future.\n\n7. **User-Centric Approach**: Always consider the user's perspective when answering queries. Tailor responses based on their preferences, allergies, and current conditions.\n\n</additional_information>\n\n<examples>\n1. **User Query**: \"What are the favorite foods of Alice?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)`, `get_food_info(2)`, and `get_food_info(3)` to get detailed information about each favorite food.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of Alice's favorite foods with details about each.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Does Charlie have any food allergies?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(35)` to retrieve Charlie's favorite food IDs.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(3)`, `get_food_allergic_ingredients(2)`, and `get_food_allergic_ingredients(7)` to check for allergies in each favorite food.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of allergic ingredients for each of Charlie's favorite foods.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Houston?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_current_weather_for_location(4)` to get the weather for Houston.\n   - **Expected Output**: A description of the current weather in Houston.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"What are the favorite foods of users who like Sushi?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `find_users_by_name(\"Frank\")` to find users who like Sushi.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(43)` to get Frank's favorite foods.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of Frank's favorite foods, including Sushi.\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What allergies does Alice have?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(1)`, `get_food_allergic_ingredients(2)`, and `get_food_allergic_ingredients(3)` to check for allergies in each favorite food.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of allergic ingredients for each of Alice's favorite foods.\n</examples>",

  "additional_information": "\nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Each function typically returns a specific type of data (e.g., strings, integers, lists of dictionaries). Familiarize yourself with the expected output types to interpret results correctly.\n\n2. **Exploring User Preferences**: When investigating user preferences, consider checking favorite foods, colors, and any potential allergies. This can help in understanding dietary restrictions or preferences.\n\n3. **Location Context**: When dealing with food or weather, always consider the user's location. This can influence food availability and meal choices.\n\n4. **Iterative Exploration**: If a function's output raises further questions, don't hesitate to call additional functions to gather more information. For example, if a user has a favorite food, check its calorie count and allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: While the environment does not explicitly mention error cases, be cautious with invalid IDs or names. If a function call does not return expected results, consider verifying the input values.\n\n6. **Documenting Findings**: Keep track of any interesting findings or patterns you observe during your exploration. This can help in answering user queries more effectively in the future.\n\n7. **User-Centric Approach**: Always consider the user's perspective when answering queries. Tailor responses based on their preferences, allergies, and current conditions.\n\n",

Familiarize yourself with the expected output types to interpret results correctly.\n\n2. **Exploring User Preferences**: When investigating user preferences, consider checking favorite foods, colors, and any potential allergies. This can help in understanding dietary restrictions or preferences.\n\n3. **Location Context**: When dealing with food or weather, always consider the user's location. This can influence food availability and meal choices.\n\n4. **Iterative Exploration**: If a function's output raises further questions, don't hesitate to call additional functions to gather more information. For example, if a user has a favorite food, check its calorie count and allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: While the environment does not explicitly mention error cases, be cautious with invalid IDs or names. If a function call does not return expected results, consider verifying the input values.\n\n6. **Documenting Findings**: Keep track of any interesting findings or patterns you observe during your exploration. This can help in answering user queries more effectively in the future.\n\n7. **User-Centric Approach**: Always consider the user's perspective when answering queries. Tailor responses based on their preferences, allergies, and current conditions.\n\n</additional_information>\n\n<examples>\n1. **User Query**: \"What are the favorite foods of Alice?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)`, `get_food_info(2)`, and `get_food_info(3)` to get detailed information about each favorite food.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of Alice's favorite foods with details about each.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Does Charlie have any food allergies?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(35)` to retrieve Charlie's favorite food IDs.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(3)`, `get_food_allergic_ingredients(2)`, and `get_food_allergic_ingredients(7)` to check for allergies in each favorite food.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of allergic ingredients for each of Charlie's favorite foods.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Houston?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_current_weather_for_location(4)` to get the weather for Houston.\n   - **Expected Output**: A description of the current weather in Houston.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"What are the favorite foods of users who like Sushi?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `find_users_by_name(\"Frank\")` to find users who like Sushi.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(43)` to get Frank's favorite foods.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of Frank's favorite foods, including Sushi.\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What allergies does Alice have?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(1)`, `get_food_allergic_ingredients(2)`, and `get_food_allergic_ingredients(3)` to check for allergies in each favorite food.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of allergic ingredients for each of Alice's favorite foods.\n</examples>"

Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries.

Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries. Familiarize yourself with the expected return types to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid or if the requested data cannot be found (e.g., non-existent user IDs). Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n</additional_information>\n\n<examples>\n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` for each food ID (1, 2, 3) to get detailed information about each food.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of food details for Alice's favorite foods.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Miami?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_current_weather_for_location(5)` to retrieve the current weather for Miami.\n   - **Expected Output**: A string describing the weather, e.g., \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F\".\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Sushi?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(3)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Sushi.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of allergic ingredients, e.g., ['Fish', 'Soy'].\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Who are the users in the system?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `list_user_ids()` to get a list of all user IDs.\n   - **Step 2**: For each user ID, call `get_user_info(user_id)` to gather detailed information about each user.\n   - **Expected Output**: A list of user details for each user in the system.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents should be able to navigate the functional environment effectively and respond to user queries efficiently."
