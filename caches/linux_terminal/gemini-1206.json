Propose function calls:\n   - For each function, suggest at least one function call that would help clarify its behavior or resolve ambiguities.\n   - If a function's return type is missing or unclear, propose a call with example input to observe the return type.\n   - If a function's argument format is ambiguous, propose multiple calls with different input formats to determine the correct usage.\n\nPlease structure your outputs as follows:\n\n<exploration_summary>\n<function_analysis>\nFor each function, describe the function call you propose that will help clarify its behavior, and what you hope to learn from the results\n</function_analysis>\n<function_list>\n   A series of your chosen function calls, in python syntax, seperated by newlines.
