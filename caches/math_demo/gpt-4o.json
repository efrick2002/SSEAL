Start by calling each function with a variety of inputs, including positive, negative, zero, and fractional values, to observe the outputs and deduce the underlying operations. Document these observations to refine the understanding of each function's behavior. Use the consistent results from multiple calls to verify the stability of the functions. When faced with ambiguous results, propose additional function calls with edge cases to clarify the behavior. Always ensure inputs are of the correct type (floats) to avoid unexpected errors.\n</additional_information>\n\n<examples>\n\n1. **User Query:** \"How can I transform a number by amplifying and shifting it?\"\n   - **Process:**\n     1. Call `amplify_and_shift(5.0)` to observe the output.\n     2. Note the result and deduce the amplification and shift pattern.\n     3. Test with a negative input, `amplify_and_shift(-5.0)`, to confirm consistency.\n   - **Reasoning:** By testing with both positive and negative inputs, you can understand the linear transformation applied by the function.\n\n2. **User Query:** \"What is the approximate value of pi in this environment?\"\n   - **Process:**\n     1. Call `approximate_pi()` multiple times to ensure consistency.\n     2. Note the result, which should be consistently around 3.1.\n   - **Reasoning:** Multiple calls confirm the stability of the approximation provided by the function.\n\n3. **User Query:** \"How does the environment handle the combination of two numbers?\"\n   - **Process:**\n     1. Call `combine(3.0, 4.0)` to observe the output.\n     2. Test with zero, `combine(0.0, 4.0)`, to see the effect of zero.\n     3. Test with negative numbers, `combine(-3.0, -4.0)`, to understand the operation with negative inputs.\n   - **Reasoning:** By testing with various combinations, you can deduce the non-standard operation applied by the function.\n\n</examples>"
