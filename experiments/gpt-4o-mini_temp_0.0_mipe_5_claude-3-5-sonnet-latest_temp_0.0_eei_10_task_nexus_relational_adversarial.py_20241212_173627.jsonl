Data Structure:\n- Users: 6 users with IDs 1,21,35,41,42,43\n- Locations: 5 cities with IDs 1-5\n- Foods: 7 items with IDs 1-7\n\n2. Search Functions:\n- c(), x(), z() are main search interfaces\n- All accept empty strings for full lists\n- Case-sensitive relevance ordering\n- Always return complete lists, just reordered\n\n3. Function Testing Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs (use k() for users)\n- Test search functions with empty string first\n- Try different cases for search terms\n- Check edge cases with special chars/numbers\n\n4. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs return error messages\n- Type mismatches may raise exceptions\n- Search functions handle empty/special chars gracefully\n\n5. Data Consistency:\n- User properties (colors, numbers, emails) are fixed\n- Location and food data is static\n- Time/weather may vary but format is consistent\n\nBest Practices:\n1. Always validate IDs before use\n2. Use search functions to discover valid entities\n3. Handle case sensitivity in searches\n4. Check function documentation for expected types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all vegetarian food options\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all foods\nfoods = c(\"\")\n# 2. Get detailed info for each\nfor food in foods:\n    details = h(food['id'])\n    if 'Fish' not in details['allergic_ingredients'] and 'Dairy' not in details['allergic_ingredients']:\n        # Salad has empty allergies list\n        print(details['name'])\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Charlie is?\"\n```python\n# 1. Get Charlie's user group numbers\nnumbers = m(35)  # Charlie's ID is 35\n# 2. These might correspond to location IDs\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num <= 5:  # Valid location IDs are 1-5\n        weather = q(num)\n        city = w(num)\n        print(f\"{city}: {weather}\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find users who like warm colors\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all users\nusers = k()\n# 2. Check each user's color\nwarm_colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow']\nfor user_id in users:\n    color = n(user_id)\n    if color in warm_colors:\n        name = j(user_id)\n        print(f\"{name} likes {color}\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Structure:\n- Users: 6 users with IDs 1,21,35,41,42,43\n- Locations: 5 cities with IDs 1-5\n- Foods: 7 items with IDs 1-7\n\n2. Search Functions:\n- c(), x(), z() are main search interfaces\n- All accept empty strings for full lists\n- Case-sensitive relevance ordering\n- Always return complete lists, just reordered\n\n3. Function Testing Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs (use k() for users)\n- Test search functions with empty string first\n- Try different cases for search terms\n- Check edge cases with special chars/numbers\n\n4. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs return error messages\n- Type mismatches may raise exceptions\n- Search functions handle empty/special chars gracefully\n\n5. Data Consistency:\n- User properties (colors, numbers, emails) are fixed\n- Location and food data is static\n- Time/weather may vary but format is consistent\n\nBest Practices:\n1. Always validate IDs before use\n2. Use search functions to discover valid entities\n3. Handle case sensitivity in searches\n4. Check function documentation for expected types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all vegetarian food options\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all foods\nfoods = c(\"\")\n# 2. Get detailed info for each\nfor food in foods:\n    details = h(food['id'])\n    if 'Fish' not in details['allergic_ingredients'] and 'Dairy' not in details['allergic_ingredients']:\n        # Salad has empty allergies list\n        print(details['name'])\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Charlie is?\"\n```python\n# 1. Get Charlie's user group numbers\nnumbers = m(35)  # Charlie's ID is 35\n# 2. These might correspond to location IDs\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num <= 5:  # Valid location IDs are 1-5\n        weather = q(num)\n        city = w(num)\n        print(f\"{city}: {weather}\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find users who like warm colors\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all users\nusers = k()\n# 2. Check each user's color\nwarm_colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow']\nfor user_id in users:\n    color = n(user_id)\n    if color in warm_colors:\n        name = j(user_id)\n        print(f\"{name} likes {color}\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Structure:\n- Users: 6 users with IDs 1,21,35,41,42,43\n- Locations: 5 cities with IDs 1-5\n- Foods: 7 items with IDs 1-7\n\n2. Search Functions:\n- c(), x(), z() are main search interfaces\n- All accept empty strings for full lists\n- Case-sensitive relevance ordering\n- Always return complete lists, just reordered\n\n3. Function Testing Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs (use k() for users)\n- Test search functions with empty string first\n- Try different cases for search terms\n- Check edge cases with special chars/numbers\n\n4. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs return error messages\n- Type mismatches may raise exceptions\n- Search functions handle empty/special chars gracefully\n\n5. Data Consistency:\n- User properties (colors, numbers, emails) are fixed\n- Location and food data is static\n- Time/weather may vary but format is consistent\n\nBest Practices:\n1. Always validate IDs before use\n2. Use search functions to discover valid entities\n3. Handle case sensitivity in searches\n4. Check function documentation for expected types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all vegetarian food options\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all foods\nfoods = c(\"\")\n# 2. Get detailed info for each\nfor food in foods:\n    details = h(food['id'])\n    if 'Fish' not in details['allergic_ingredients'] and 'Dairy' not in details['allergic_ingredients']:\n        # Salad has empty allergies list\n        print(details['name'])\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Charlie is?\"\n```python\n# 1. Get Charlie's user group numbers\nnumbers = m(35)  # Charlie's ID is 35\n# 2. These might correspond to location IDs\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num <= 5:  # Valid location IDs are 1-5\n        weather = q(num)\n        city = w(num)\n        print(f\"{city}: {weather}\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find users who like warm colors\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all users\nusers = k()\n# 2. Check each user's color\nwarm_colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow']\nfor user_id in users:\n    color = n(user_id)\n    if color in warm_colors:\n        name = j(user_id)\n        print(f\"{name} likes {color}\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Data Structure:\n- Users: 6 users with IDs 1,21,35,41,42,43\n- Locations: 5 cities with IDs 1-5\n- Foods: 7 items with IDs 1-7\n\n2. Search Functions:\n- c(), x(), z() are main search interfaces\n- All accept empty strings for full lists\n- Case-sensitive relevance ordering\n- Always return complete lists, just reordered\n\n3. Function Testing Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs (use k() for users)\n- Test search functions with empty string first\n- Try different cases for search terms\n- Check edge cases with special chars/numbers\n\n4. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs return error messages\n- Type mismatches may raise exceptions\n- Search functions handle empty/special chars gracefully\n\n5. Data Consistency:\n- User properties (colors, numbers, emails) are fixed\n- Location and food data is static\n- Time/weather may vary but format is consistent\n\nBest Practices:\n1. Always validate IDs before use\n2. Use search functions to discover valid entities\n3. Handle case sensitivity in searches\n4. Check function documentation for expected types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all vegetarian food options\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all foods\nfoods = c(\"\")\n# 2. Get detailed info for each\nfor food in foods:\n    details = h(food['id'])\n    if 'Fish' not in details['allergic_ingredients'] and 'Dairy' not in details['allergic_ingredients']:\n        # Salad has empty allergies list\n        print(details['name'])\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Charlie is?\"\n```python\n# 1. Get Charlie's user group numbers\nnumbers = m(35)  # Charlie's ID is 35\n# 2. These might correspond to location IDs\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num <= 5:  # Valid location IDs are 1-5\n        weather = q(num)\n        city = w(num)\n        print(f\"{city}: {weather}\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find users who like warm colors\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all users\nusers = k()\n# 2. Check each user's color\nwarm_colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow']\nfor user_id in users:\n    color = n(user_id)\n    if color in warm_colors:\n        name = j(user_id)\n        print(f\"{name} likes {color}\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Structure:\n- Users: 6 users with IDs 1,21,35,41,42,43\n- Locations: 5 cities with IDs 1-5\n- Foods: 7 items with IDs 1-7\n\n2. Search Functions:\n- c(), x(), z() are main search interfaces\n- All accept empty strings for full lists\n- Case-sensitive relevance ordering\n- Always return complete lists, just reordered\n\n3. Function Testing Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs (use k() for users)\n- Test search functions with empty string first\n- Try different cases for search terms\n- Check edge cases with special chars/numbers\n\n4. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs return error messages\n- Type mismatches may raise exceptions\n- Search functions handle empty/special chars gracefully\n\n5. Data Consistency:\n- User properties (colors, numbers, emails) are fixed\n- Location and food data is static\n- Time/weather may vary but format is consistent\n\nBest Practices:\n1. Always validate IDs before use\n2. Use search functions to discover valid entities\n3. Handle case sensitivity in searches\n4. Check function documentation for expected types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all vegetarian food options\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all foods\nfoods = c(\"\")\n# 2. Get detailed info for each\nfor food in foods:\n    details = h(food['id'])\n    if 'Fish' not in details['allergic_ingredients'] and 'Dairy' not in details['allergic_ingredients']:\n        # Salad has empty allergies list\n        print(details['name'])\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Charlie is?\"\n```python\n# 1. Get Charlie's user group numbers\nnumbers = m(35)  # Charlie's ID is 35\n# 2. These might correspond to location IDs\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num <= 5:  # Valid location IDs are 1-5\n        weather = q(num)\n        city = w(num)\n        print(f\"{city}: {weather}\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find users who like warm colors\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all users\nusers = k()\n# 2. Check each user's color\nwarm_colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow']\nfor user_id in users:\n    color = n(user_id)\n    if color in warm_colors:\n        name = j(user_id)\n        print(f\"{name} likes {color}\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
