Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7.

Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9.

Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Structure:\n   - The environment simulates a Unix-like file system with a /tmp directory.\n   - File and directory operations are performed mainly in the /tmp directory.\n   - The environment maintains its own set of environment variables.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions mimic Unix commands but may have slight differences.\n   - Error handling is inconsistent across functions. Some raise exceptions, others return error messages.\n   - The 'super()' function doesn't seem to have any visible effect and its purpose is unclear.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Use 'lay_path()' to create files or directories.\n   - Use 'destory()' to remove files or directories (note the misspelling).\n   - Use 'move_it()' to move or rename files and directories.\n   - Use 'write_next()' and 'write_over()' for file writing operations.\n   - Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n\n4. Directory Operations:\n   - Use 'look_in()' to list directory contents.\n   - 'look_in()' cannot be used on individual files.\n\n5. Permission Operations:\n   - Use 'mod_perms()' to change file permissions.\n   - Permissions are represented as 9-character strings (e.g., \"rwxr-xr-x\").\n\n6. Environment Variables:\n   - Use 'export_env()' to set environment variables.\n   - Environment variables can be used in 'callback()' function.\n\n7. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use 'match_it()' for grep-like functionality, but note that it doesn't produce visible output in some cases.\n\n8. Command History:\n   - Use 'look_back()' to view the command history.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished using the available functions.\n2. Use 'lay_path()' to create any necessary files or directories.\n3. Use 'write_over()' or 'write_next()' to add content to files.\n4. Use 'look_in()' to check directory contents.\n5. Use 'view()' to read file contents.\n6. Use 'move_it()' or 'destory()' for file management.\n7. Use 'mod_perms()' if permission changes are needed.\n8. Use 'export_env()' and 'callback()' for environment variable operations.\n9. Always check the output of each function call to ensure the operation was successful.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 2: \"Create a directory structure /tmp/test/nested, create a file 'example.txt' in the nested directory with some content, then move it to /tmp.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the directory structure\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Add content to the file\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"This is an example file.\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Verify the file was created\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp/test/nested\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Move the file to /tmp\n<function_list>\nmove_it(\"/tmp/test/nested/example.txt\", \"/tmp/example.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 5: Verify the file was moved\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n</function_list>\n\nExample 3: \"Set an environment variable 'GREETING' to 'Hello', create a file that uses this variable, then read its contents.\"\n\nStep 1: Set the environment variable\n<function_list>\nexport_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Create a file using the environment variable\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\", \"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Read the file contents\n<function_list>\nview(\"/tmp/greeting.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 4: Use callback to see how the environment variable is expanded\n<function_list>\ncallback(\"$GREETING, World!\")\n</function_list>\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to combine multiple function calls to achieve more complex tasks in the environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
