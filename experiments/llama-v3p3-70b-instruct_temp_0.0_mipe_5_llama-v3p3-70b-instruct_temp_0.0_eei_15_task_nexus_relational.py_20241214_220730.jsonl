information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1.

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them in a specific order and using the returned values to inform the next function call.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n2. Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about a user, location, or food.\n3. Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about a user.\n4. Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve information about the current weather and time at a location.\n5. Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can answer user queries and retrieve information about users, locations, and foods in this environment.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the functions to answer user queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's data.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's data.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's data.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
