The environment does not provide feedback on the creation of files or directories, so manual verification is necessary. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **File and Directory Verification:**\n   - Before using functions that operate on files or directories, manually verify their existence in the environment. This can be done by using the `look_in` function to list directory contents.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Be prepared to handle common errors such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`. These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior. Gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in the function's operation.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the detailed function documentation provided above to understand the expected inputs, outputs, and error cases for each function.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Checking File Existence and Viewing Contents**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file in the environment?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Use `look_in('/path/to/directory')` to verify the file exists in the specified directory.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `view('/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to display its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the file exists using `look_in('/path/to/directory')`.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to change its permissions.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I move a file from one directory to another?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3. If both exist, use `move_it('/source/directory/file.txt', '/destination/directory/')` to move the file.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior.

The environment does not provide feedback on the creation of files or directories, so manual verification is necessary. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **File and Directory Verification:**\n   - Before using functions that operate on files or directories, manually verify their existence in the environment. This can be done by using the `look_in` function to list directory contents.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Be prepared to handle common errors such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`. These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior. Gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in the function's operation.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the detailed function documentation provided above to understand the expected inputs, outputs, and error cases for each function.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Checking File Existence and Viewing Contents**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file in the environment?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Use `look_in('/path/to/directory')` to verify the file exists in the specified directory.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `view('/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to display its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the file exists using `look_in('/path/to/directory')`.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to change its permissions.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I move a file from one directory to another?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3. If both exist, use `move_it('/source/directory/file.txt', '/destination/directory/')` to move the file.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment does not provide feedback on the creation of files or directories, so manual verification is necessary. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **File and Directory Verification:**\n   - Before using functions that operate on files or directories, manually verify their existence in the environment. This can be done by using the `look_in` function to list directory contents.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Be prepared to handle common errors such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`. These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior. Gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in the function's operation.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the detailed function documentation provided above to understand the expected inputs, outputs, and error cases for each function.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Checking File Existence and Viewing Contents**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file in the environment?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Use `look_in('/path/to/directory')` to verify the file exists in the specified directory.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `view('/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to display its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the file exists using `look_in('/path/to/directory')`.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to change its permissions.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I move a file from one directory to another?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3. If both exist, use `move_it('/source/directory/file.txt', '/destination/directory/')` to move the file.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment does not provide feedback on the creation of files or directories, so manual verification is necessary. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **File and Directory Verification:**\n   - Before using functions that operate on files or directories, manually verify their existence in the environment. This can be done by using the `look_in` function to list directory contents.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Be prepared to handle common errors such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`. These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior. Gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in the function's operation.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the detailed function documentation provided above to understand the expected inputs, outputs, and error cases for each function.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Checking File Existence and Viewing Contents**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file in the environment?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Use `look_in('/path/to/directory')` to verify the file exists in the specified directory.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `view('/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to display its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the file exists using `look_in('/path/to/directory')`.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to change its permissions.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I move a file from one directory to another?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3. If both exist, use `move_it('/source/directory/file.txt', '/destination/directory/')` to move the file.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment does not provide feedback on the creation of files or directories, so manual verification is necessary. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **File and Directory Verification:**\n   - Before using functions that operate on files or directories, manually verify their existence in the environment. This can be done by using the `look_in` function to list directory contents.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Be prepared to handle common errors such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`. These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior. Gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in the function's operation.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the detailed function documentation provided above to understand the expected inputs, outputs, and error cases for each function.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Checking File Existence and Viewing Contents**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file in the environment?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Use `look_in('/path/to/directory')` to verify the file exists in the specified directory.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `view('/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to display its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the file exists using `look_in('/path/to/directory')`.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to change its permissions.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I move a file from one directory to another?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3. If both exist, use `move_it('/source/directory/file.txt', '/destination/directory/')` to move the file.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment does not provide feedback on the creation of files or directories, so manual verification is necessary. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **File and Directory Verification:**\n   - Before using functions that operate on files or directories, manually verify their existence in the environment. This can be done by using the `look_in` function to list directory contents.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Be prepared to handle common errors such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`. These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior. Gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in the function's operation.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the detailed function documentation provided above to understand the expected inputs, outputs, and error cases for each function.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Checking File Existence and Viewing Contents**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file in the environment?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Use `look_in('/path/to/directory')` to verify the file exists in the specified directory.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `view('/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to display its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the file exists using `look_in('/path/to/directory')`.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to change its permissions.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I move a file from one directory to another?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3. If both exist, use `move_it('/source/directory/file.txt', '/destination/directory/')` to move the file.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

The environment does not provide feedback on the creation of files or directories, so manual verification is necessary. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **File and Directory Verification:**\n   - Before using functions that operate on files or directories, manually verify their existence in the environment. This can be done by using the `look_in` function to list directory contents.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Be prepared to handle common errors such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`. These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior. Gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in the function's operation.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the detailed function documentation provided above to understand the expected inputs, outputs, and error cases for each function.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Checking File Existence and Viewing Contents**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file in the environment?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Use `look_in('/path/to/directory')` to verify the file exists in the specified directory.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `view('/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to display its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the file exists using `look_in('/path/to/directory')`.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to change its permissions.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I move a file from one directory to another?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3. If both exist, use `move_it('/source/directory/file.txt', '/destination/directory/')` to move the file.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3.

The environment does not provide feedback on the creation of files or directories, so manual verification is necessary. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **File and Directory Verification:**\n   - Before using functions that operate on files or directories, manually verify their existence in the environment. This can be done by using the `look_in` function to list directory contents.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Be prepared to handle common errors such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`. These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior. Gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in the function's operation.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the detailed function documentation provided above to understand the expected inputs, outputs, and error cases for each function.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Checking File Existence and Viewing Contents**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file in the environment?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Use `look_in('/path/to/directory')` to verify the file exists in the specified directory.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `view('/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to display its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the file exists using `look_in('/path/to/directory')`.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to change its permissions.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I move a file from one directory to another?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3. If both exist, use `move_it('/source/directory/file.txt', '/destination/directory/')` to move the file.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment does not provide feedback on the creation of files or directories, so manual verification is necessary. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **File and Directory Verification:**\n   - Before using functions that operate on files or directories, manually verify their existence in the environment. This can be done by using the `look_in` function to list directory contents.\n\n2. **Error Handling:**\n   - Be prepared to handle common errors such as `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`. These errors indicate issues with file paths or permissions that need to be resolved before proceeding.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:**\n   - If you encounter persistent issues with non-existent files, consider setting up a controlled environment where you can create and manage test files and directories. This will help ensure that the paths you use in function calls are valid.\n\n4. **Function Testing:**\n   - When testing functions, start with simple and well-defined cases to understand their behavior. Gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence in the function's operation.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the detailed function documentation provided above to understand the expected inputs, outputs, and error cases for each function.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Checking File Existence and Viewing Contents**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file in the environment?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Use `look_in('/path/to/directory')` to verify the file exists in the specified directory.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `view('/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to display its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the file exists using `look_in('/path/to/directory')`.\n  2. If the file is listed, use `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/directory/file.txt')` to change its permissions.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"How can I move a file from one directory to another?\"\n- **Step-by-Step Process:**\n  1. Verify the source file exists using `look_in('/source/directory')`.\n  2. Verify the destination directory exists using `look_in('/destination/directory')`.\n  3. If both exist, use `move_it('/source/directory/file.txt', '/destination/directory/')` to move the file.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
