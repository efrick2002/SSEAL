File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6.

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6.

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content.

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
