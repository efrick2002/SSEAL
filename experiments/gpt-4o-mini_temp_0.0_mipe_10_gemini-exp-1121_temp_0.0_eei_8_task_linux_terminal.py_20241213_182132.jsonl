Key limitations include:\n\n*   **No Directory Creation:**  The `lay_path` function only creates files, not directories. This restricts the use of `move_it` and potentially other functions.\n*   **Restricted Permissions:** The `destory` function is unusable due to persistent \"Permission denied\" errors.\n*   **No True File Deletion:**  While `destory` is intended to delete files, it doesn't work. Files can be overwritten using `write_over` with empty content, but they are not truly deleted.\n*   **Limited Pattern Matching:** `match_it` provides basic pattern matching but doesn't seem to support more advanced features like regular expressions or alternation.\n\nTo interact with the environment, submit function calls within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will respond with a list of dictionaries, each containing the `call` (the function call string) and the `result` (the output or error message). Analyze the results to understand the behavior of the functions and build up your solution step by step. Keep in mind the limitations described above.\n\nThe `look_back` function can be useful for reviewing the history of commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Create a file, write content, and view it.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a file named \"output.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" into it, and display its contents.\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"output.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"output.txt\", \"Hello, world!\")\nview(\"output.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Find a pattern in a file.**\n\n*   **User Query:**  Create a file named \"data.txt\" with the content \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\". Find the line containing \"pattern\".\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"data.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"data.txt\", \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\")\nmatch_it(\"pattern\", \"data.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 3 (Illustrating limitations): Move a file to a new directory.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a directory \"my_dir\" and move \"file.txt\" into it.\n\n*   **Solution:** This is not possible in the current environment because directory creation (`lay_path` with `mode='directory'`) is not supported. You would have to explain this limitation to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Key limitations include:\n\n*   **No Directory Creation:**  The `lay_path` function only creates files, not directories. This restricts the use of `move_it` and potentially other functions.\n*   **Restricted Permissions:** The `destory` function is unusable due to persistent \"Permission denied\" errors.\n*   **No True File Deletion:**  While `destory` is intended to delete files, it doesn't work. Files can be overwritten using `write_over` with empty content, but they are not truly deleted.\n*   **Limited Pattern Matching:** `match_it` provides basic pattern matching but doesn't seem to support more advanced features like regular expressions or alternation.\n\nTo interact with the environment, submit function calls within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will respond with a list of dictionaries, each containing the `call` (the function call string) and the `result` (the output or error message). Analyze the results to understand the behavior of the functions and build up your solution step by step. Keep in mind the limitations described above.\n\nThe `look_back` function can be useful for reviewing the history of commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Create a file, write content, and view it.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a file named \"output.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" into it, and display its contents.\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"output.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"output.txt\", \"Hello, world!\")\nview(\"output.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Find a pattern in a file.**\n\n*   **User Query:**  Create a file named \"data.txt\" with the content \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\". Find the line containing \"pattern\".\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"data.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"data.txt\", \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\")\nmatch_it(\"pattern\", \"data.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 3 (Illustrating limitations): Move a file to a new directory.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a directory \"my_dir\" and move \"file.txt\" into it.\n\n*   **Solution:** This is not possible in the current environment because directory creation (`lay_path` with `mode='directory'`) is not supported. You would have to explain this limitation to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Key limitations include:\n\n*   **No Directory Creation:**  The `lay_path` function only creates files, not directories. This restricts the use of `move_it` and potentially other functions.\n*   **Restricted Permissions:** The `destory` function is unusable due to persistent \"Permission denied\" errors.\n*   **No True File Deletion:**  While `destory` is intended to delete files, it doesn't work. Files can be overwritten using `write_over` with empty content, but they are not truly deleted.\n*   **Limited Pattern Matching:** `match_it` provides basic pattern matching but doesn't seem to support more advanced features like regular expressions or alternation.\n\nTo interact with the environment, submit function calls within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will respond with a list of dictionaries, each containing the `call` (the function call string) and the `result` (the output or error message). Analyze the results to understand the behavior of the functions and build up your solution step by step. Keep in mind the limitations described above.\n\nThe `look_back` function can be useful for reviewing the history of commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Create a file, write content, and view it.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a file named \"output.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" into it, and display its contents.\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"output.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"output.txt\", \"Hello, world!\")\nview(\"output.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Find a pattern in a file.**\n\n*   **User Query:**  Create a file named \"data.txt\" with the content \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\". Find the line containing \"pattern\".\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"data.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"data.txt\", \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\")\nmatch_it(\"pattern\", \"data.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 3 (Illustrating limitations): Move a file to a new directory.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a directory \"my_dir\" and move \"file.txt\" into it.\n\n*   **Solution:** This is not possible in the current environment because directory creation (`lay_path` with `mode='directory'`) is not supported. You would have to explain this limitation to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Key limitations include:\n\n*   **No Directory Creation:**  The `lay_path` function only creates files, not directories. This restricts the use of `move_it` and potentially other functions.\n*   **Restricted Permissions:** The `destory` function is unusable due to persistent \"Permission denied\" errors.\n*   **No True File Deletion:**  While `destory` is intended to delete files, it doesn't work. Files can be overwritten using `write_over` with empty content, but they are not truly deleted.\n*   **Limited Pattern Matching:** `match_it` provides basic pattern matching but doesn't seem to support more advanced features like regular expressions or alternation.\n\nTo interact with the environment, submit function calls within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will respond with a list of dictionaries, each containing the `call` (the function call string) and the `result` (the output or error message). Analyze the results to understand the behavior of the functions and build up your solution step by step. Keep in mind the limitations described above.\n\nThe `look_back` function can be useful for reviewing the history of commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Create a file, write content, and view it.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a file named \"output.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" into it, and display its contents.\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"output.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"output.txt\", \"Hello, world!\")\nview(\"output.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Find a pattern in a file.**\n\n*   **User Query:**  Create a file named \"data.txt\" with the content \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\". Find the line containing \"pattern\".\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"data.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"data.txt\", \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\")\nmatch_it(\"pattern\", \"data.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 3 (Illustrating limitations): Move a file to a new directory.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a directory \"my_dir\" and move \"file.txt\" into it.\n\n*   **Solution:** This is not possible in the current environment because directory creation (`lay_path` with `mode='directory'`) is not supported. You would have to explain this limitation to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This restricts the use of `move_it` and potentially other functions.\n*   **Restricted Permissions:** The `destory` function is unusable due to persistent \"Permission denied\" errors.\n*   **No True File Deletion:**  While `destory` is intended to delete files, it doesn't work. Files can be overwritten using `write_over` with empty content, but they are not truly deleted.\n*   **Limited Pattern Matching:** `match_it` provides basic pattern matching but doesn't seem to support more advanced features like regular expressions or alternation.\n\nTo interact with the environment, submit function calls within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will respond with a list of dictionaries, each containing the `call` (the function call string) and the `result` (the output or error message). Analyze the results to understand the behavior of the functions and build up your solution step by step. Keep in mind the limitations described above.\n\nThe `look_back` function can be useful for reviewing the history of commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Create a file, write content, and view it.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a file named \"output.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" into it, and display its contents.\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"output.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"output.txt\", \"Hello, world!\")\nview(\"output.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Find a pattern in a file.**\n\n*   **User Query:**  Create a file named \"data.txt\" with the content \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\". Find the line containing \"pattern\".\n\n*   **Solution:**\n\n<function_list>\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"data.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"data.txt\", \"Line 1\\nLine 2 with pattern\\nLine 3\")\nmatch_it(\"pattern\", \"data.txt\")\n</function_list>\n</function_list>\n\n**Example 3 (Illustrating limitations): Move a file to a new directory.**\n\n*   **User Query:** Create a directory \"my_dir\" and move \"file.txt\" into it.\n\n*   **Solution:** This is not possible in the current environment because directory creation (`lay_path` with `mode='directory'`) is not supported. You would have to explain this limitation to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
