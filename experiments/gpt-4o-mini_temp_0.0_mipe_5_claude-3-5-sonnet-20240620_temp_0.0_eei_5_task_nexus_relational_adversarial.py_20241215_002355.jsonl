Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - Most functions accept integer IDs (user, location, food) as input.\n   - Functions b, c, f, g, h, j, m, n, q, r, t, u, v, w, y directly operate on these IDs.\n   - Functions x and z accept lists of IDs or empty lists to return all items.\n   - Functions i and k don't require any input.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will raise exceptions for invalid IDs.\n   - Type errors may occur if incorrect input types are provided (e.g., passing an int where a list is expected).\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite colors, and favorite foods.\n   - Locations have cities, current times, and weather information.\n   - Foods have names, calorie counts, and allergic ingredients.\n\n4. Querying Strategy:\n   - Start with high-level functions (z for users, x for locations, c for foods) to get an overview of available data.\n   - Use specific ID-based functions to get detailed information about individual items.\n   - Combine function calls to answer complex queries (e.g., use f to get a user's location, then g to get that location's weather).\n\n5. Limitations:\n   - The environment doesn't support direct text queries. All interactions must be done through function calls.\n   - Some functions (like q and r) appear to be duplicates, so use either one for weather information.\n\n6. Best Practices:\n   - Always check the return type of a function before processing its output.\n   - Handle exceptions gracefully, especially for functions that may raise them for invalid IDs.\n   - Use empty list inputs for x, z, and c to get all available data when needed.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Alice's ID from the result (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\nb(1)  # This returns Alice's location ID (assume it's 1)\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\nq(1)  # This returns the weather for location ID 1\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Bob's ID from the result (assume it's 21)\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\nm(21)  # This returns Bob's favorite food IDs (e.g., [4, 5, 6])\n\nStep 3: Get the names of Bob's favorite foods\nfavorite_foods = []\nfor food_id in [4, 5, 6]:\n    favorite_foods.append(t(food_id))\n\nFinal Answer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Charlie's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\nz([])  # This returns all users\n# Find Charlie's ID from the result (assume it's 35)\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\nm(35)  # This returns Charlie's favorite food IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3])\n\nStep 3: Calculate total calories\ntotal_calories = 0\nfor food_id in [1, 2, 3]:\n    total_calories += y(food_id)\n\nFinal Answer: The total calories in Charlie's favorite foods is [total_calories].\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
