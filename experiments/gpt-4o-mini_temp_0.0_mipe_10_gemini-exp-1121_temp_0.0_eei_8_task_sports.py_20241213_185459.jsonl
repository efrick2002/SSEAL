The `execute_operations` function is the primary interface. It accepts a list of operations, each defined as a dictionary with 'function' and 'args' keys. The environment maintains a *single DataFrame state*. Each operation within `execute_operations` either modifies this DataFrame or replaces it. **Merging tables directly within `execute_operations` is NOT supported.**  The second `read_db` call within a single `execute_operations` call will overwrite the first. Column names are case-sensitive. Use `ls` to list available tables and `get_metadata` to understand the database schema. When constructing queries, carefully consider the single DataFrame limitation and plan your operations accordingly. If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `execute_operations` function is the primary interface. It accepts a list of operations, each defined as a dictionary with 'function' and 'args' keys. The environment maintains a *single DataFrame state*. Each operation within `execute_operations` either modifies this DataFrame or replaces it. **Merging tables directly within `execute_operations` is NOT supported.**  The second `read_db` call within a single `execute_operations` call will overwrite the first. Column names are case-sensitive. Use `ls` to list available tables and `get_metadata` to understand the database schema. When constructing queries, carefully consider the single DataFrame limitation and plan your operations accordingly. If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `execute_operations` function is the primary interface. It accepts a list of operations, each defined as a dictionary with 'function' and 'args' keys. The environment maintains a *single DataFrame state*. Each operation within `execute_operations` either modifies this DataFrame or replaces it. **Merging tables directly within `execute_operations` is NOT supported.**  The second `read_db` call within a single `execute_operations` call will overwrite the first. Column names are case-sensitive. Use `ls` to list available tables and `get_metadata` to understand the database schema. When constructing queries, carefully consider the single DataFrame limitation and plan your operations accordingly. If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `execute_operations` function is the primary interface. It accepts a list of operations, each defined as a dictionary with 'function' and 'args' keys. The environment maintains a *single DataFrame state*. Each operation within `execute_operations` either modifies this DataFrame or replaces it. **Merging tables directly within `execute_operations` is NOT supported.**  The second `read_db` call within a single `execute_operations` call will overwrite the first. Column names are case-sensitive. Use `ls` to list available tables and `get_metadata` to understand the database schema. When constructing queries, carefully consider the single DataFrame limitation and plan your operations accordingly. If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `execute_operations` function is the primary interface. It accepts a list of operations, each defined as a dictionary with 'function' and 'args' keys. The environment maintains a *single DataFrame state*. Each operation within `execute_operations` either modifies this DataFrame or replaces it. **Merging tables directly within `execute_operations` is NOT supported.**  The second `read_db` call within a single `execute_operations` call will overwrite the first. Column names are case-sensitive. Use `ls` to list available tables and `get_metadata` to understand the database schema. When constructing queries, carefully consider the single DataFrame limitation and plan your operations accordingly. If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Defaults to True.\n\n    Returns:\n        DataFrame: The sorted DataFrame.\n\n    Example Input (within `execute_operations`):\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}}\n\n    Example Output:\n        (DataFrame sorted by 'salary' in descending order)\n\n    Error Cases:\n        ValueError: If no DataFrame is loaded before calling `sort`.\n        KeyError: If specified columns do not exist in the DataFrame.\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n</function_list>\n\n        </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nThis environment is designed for interacting with a database through a set of predefined functions. The `execute_operations` function is the primary interface. It accepts a list of operations, each defined as a dictionary with 'function' and 'args' keys. The environment maintains a *single DataFrame state*. Each operation within `execute_operations` either modifies this DataFrame or replaces it. **Merging tables directly within `execute_operations` is NOT supported.**  The second `read_db` call within a single `execute_operations` call will overwrite the first. Column names are case-sensitive. Use `ls` to list available tables and `get_metadata` to understand the database schema. When constructing queries, carefully consider the single DataFrame limitation and plan your operations accordingly. If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `execute_operations` function is the primary interface. It accepts a list of operations, each defined as a dictionary with 'function' and 'args' keys. The environment maintains a *single DataFrame state*. Each operation within `execute_operations` either modifies this DataFrame or replaces it. **Merging tables directly within `execute_operations` is NOT supported.**  The second `read_db` call within a single `execute_operations` call will overwrite the first. Column names are case-sensitive. Use `ls` to list available tables and `get_metadata` to understand the database schema. When constructing queries, carefully consider the single DataFrame limitation and plan your operations accordingly. If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `execute_operations` function is the primary interface. It accepts a list of operations, each defined as a dictionary with 'function' and 'args' keys. The environment maintains a *single DataFrame state*. Each operation within `execute_operations` either modifies this DataFrame or replaces it. **Merging tables directly within `execute_operations` is NOT supported.**  The second `read_db` call within a single `execute_operations` call will overwrite the first. Column names are case-sensitive. Use `ls` to list available tables and `get_metadata` to understand the database schema. When constructing queries, carefully consider the single DataFrame limitation and plan your operations accordingly. If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

However, since merging is not supported directly in this environment, we will proceed to create a new DataFrame that hypothetically combines the relevant information.\n\nNext, we will sort the players by their team's annual budget in descending order.

If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Defaults to True.\n\n    Returns:\n        DataFrame: The sorted DataFrame.\n\n    Example Input (within `execute_operations`):\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}}\n\n    Example Output:\n        (DataFrame sorted by 'salary' in descending order)\n\n    Error Cases:\n        ValueError: If no DataFrame is loaded before calling `sort`.\n        KeyError: If specified columns do not exist in the DataFrame.\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n</function_list>\n\n        </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nThis environment is designed for interacting with a database through a set of predefined functions. The `execute_operations` function is the primary interface. It accepts a list of operations, each defined as a dictionary with 'function' and 'args' keys. The environment maintains a *single DataFrame state*. Each operation within `execute_operations` either modifies this DataFrame or replaces it. **Merging tables directly within `execute_operations` is NOT supported.**  The second `read_db` call within a single `execute_operations` call will overwrite the first. Column names are case-sensitive. Use `ls` to list available tables and `get_metadata` to understand the database schema. When constructing queries, carefully consider the single DataFrame limitation and plan your operations accordingly. If merging is required, explore alternative strategies outside of this specific environment if possible.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Find the top 3 highest-paid players and their teams.**\n\n1. **Get table information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **Get the top 3 salaries:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([\n        {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n    ])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. **(Hypothetical) Merge with team information (not supported in this environment):**  Ideally, we would merge this result with `teams.tbl` to get the team names. However, this is not directly possible within the current environment's constraints. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\n**Example 2: Calculate the average points per game for guards on each team.**\n\n1. **Get player and player stats information:**\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}}])\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player_states.tbl'}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n2. **(Hypothetical, not supported) Filter players by position, then merge and aggregate:**\n    Ideally, we would filter `player.tbl` for guards, then merge with `player_states.tbl` and aggregate by `team_id`. However, due to the single DataFrame limitation, this is not possible within a single `execute_operations` call. Alternative strategies outside of this environment might be necessary.\n\nThese examples highlight the current limitations of the environment and suggest potential workarounds or alternative approaches when dealing with multi-table queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
