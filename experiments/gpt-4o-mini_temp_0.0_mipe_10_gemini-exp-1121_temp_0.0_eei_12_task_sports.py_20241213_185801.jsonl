The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Combine this mapping with the average salary data.\n\nSince I cannot use `merge_tables`, I will manually create the final output by matching the results.\n\nHere are the function calls I will make:\n\n<function_list>\nexecute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                    {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': 'team_id', 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}},\n                    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}}])\nexecute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}}])\n</function_list>",
   "The output provides the average salary of players grouped by `team_id` and also includes the team names along with their corresponding `team_id`. \n\nNow, I will manually combine the average salary data with the team names based on `team_id` to create the final result. The final table will include only the `team_name` and the average `salary`, sorted from highest to lowest average salary.\n\nHere are the final function calls to create the desired output:\n\n<function_list>\nexecute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                    {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': 'team_id', 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}},\n                    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}}])\n</function_list>",
   "The output still provides the average salary of players grouped by `team_id`, but it does not include the team names in the final result. Since I cannot merge the data due to the malfunctioning `merge_tables` function, I will manually create the final output by matching the average salaries with their corresponding team names based on the previous results.\n\nHere are the average salaries and their corresponding team names based on the earlier outputs:\n\n- Team: Lakers (team_id: 1) - Average Salary: 44,500,000.0\n- Team: Warriors (team_id: 4) - Average Salary: 44,335,007.0\n- Team: Nets (team_id: 6) - Average Salary: 44,119,845.0\n- Team: Celtics (team_id: 2) - Average Salary: 37,084,800.0\n- Team: Heat (team_id: 5) - Average Salary: 35,126,650.0\n- Team: Bulls (team_id: 3) - Average Salary: 28,000,000.0\n\nNow, I will create the final output table with only the `team_name` and `salary` columns, sorted from highest to lowest average salary.\n\nSince I cannot perform this operation directly in the environment, I will conclude that the output does not fully satisfy the user's query.\n\nThus, I will output `<end_query>` as the final result."

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The output of one operation is implicitly passed as the first argument to the next operation within the same call. Do *not* explicitly pass DataFrames to functions within `execute_operations`.\n\n2. **No DataFrame Persistence:** DataFrames are *not* stored between calls to `execute_operations`. Each call starts with a clean slate. You must read the necessary tables within each `execute_operations` call.\n\n3. **`merge_tables` Malfunction:** The `merge_tables` function appears to be broken and should not be used.\n\n4. **`select` Limitations:** The `select` function only supports equality conditions on string columns. Conditions involving operators (>, <, etc.) or numeric columns will result in errors.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy:** To answer user queries, start by listing available tables using `ls()` and examining the schema with `get_metadata()`. Then, use `read_db()`, `select()`, `aggregate()`, `calculate_column()`, `sort()`, and `limit()` within `execute_operations()` to manipulate the data and generate the desired results. Remember the sequential and non-persistent nature of operations.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Which team has the highest annual budget?**\n\n1. Get the table with team information:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... teams.tbl ...\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])\n    # Output: ... Teams Table: - Basic team information - Annual budget ...\n    </function_list>\n\n2. Read the `teams.tbl` table and sort it by `annual_budget` in descending order:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n3. Limit the result to the top row to get the team with the highest budget:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'teams.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'annual_budget', 'ascending': False}},\n                        {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 1}}])\n    </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: What is the average salary of players in Los Angeles?**\n\n1. Identify relevant tables:  `player.tbl` (player info, salaries, team\\_id), `teams.tbl` (team location, team\\_id). However, since `merge_tables` is not working, we'll need to filter based on team name.\n\n2. Read the `player.tbl` and filter for players on the Lakers (Los Angeles team):\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}}]) # Example using a known Lakers player\n    </function_list>\n    Note: This assumes we know a player on the Lakers. A more robust solution would require a working `merge_tables` function.\n\n3. Calculate the average salary:\n    <function_list>\n    execute_operations([{'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n                        {'function': 'select', 'args': {'conditions': {'name': 'LeBron James'}}},\n                        {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'group_by': [], 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}}])\n    </function_list>\n    This will give the average salary of the selected player(s).\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
