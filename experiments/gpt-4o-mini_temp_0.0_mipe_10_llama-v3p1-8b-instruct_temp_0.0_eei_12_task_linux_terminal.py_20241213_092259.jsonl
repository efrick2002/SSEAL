Find the function call that satisfies the query. Use the environments output to verify the function call was correct.\n\n        Here is the list of functions you have access to:\n\n        <functions>\n        \n   Modify the list of function contexts provided. Specifically add/improve docstrings and argument types and return types. You should be very detailed, consider what ambiguities gave you trouble at the beginning. Give example argument inputs, example function outputs, and observed error cases. Make sure it is absolutely clear when and how to use each function. Make sure to include all functions.\n   destory(path, recursive=False, force=False)\n   The `destory` function still returns an empty string, which suggests that it is not deleting the file. This could be due to the file not existing or the permissions not allowing deletion.\n\n   export_env(var, value)\n   The `export_env` function still returns an empty string, which suggests that it is not exporting the variable.\n\n   lay_path(path, mode='file')\n   The `lay_path` function still returns `None`, which suggests that it is not laying out the path.\n\n   look_in(path='/', all=False, show_perm=False)\n   The `look_in` function still raises an exception when trying to access a directory that does not exist. This suggests that the function is attempting to use the `ls` command to list the directory contents.\n\n   match_it(pattern, *files)\n   The `match_it` function still returns an empty string, which suggests that it is not matching any files.\n\n   mod_perms(mode, path)\n   The `mod_perms` function raises an exception when trying to set a permission mode that is not 9 characters long. This suggests that the function is attempting to use the `chmod` command to set the permissions.\n\n   move_it(src, dest)\n   The `move_it` function raises an exception when trying to move a file that does Nations. This suggests that the function is attempting to use the `mv` command to move the file.\n\n   super()\n   The `super` function returns an empty string, which suggests that it is not doing anything.\n\n   view(*files)\n   The `view` function returns the content of the file, which suggests that it is successfully viewing the file.\n\n   write_next(filename, content)\n   The `write_next` function still returns an empty string, which suggests that it is not writing to the file.\n\n   write_over(filename, content)\n   The `write_over` function still returns an empty string, which suggests that it is not writing to the file.\n\n        </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n   Any clarifications, learnings, guides etc. Focus on how to interact with the environment.

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
