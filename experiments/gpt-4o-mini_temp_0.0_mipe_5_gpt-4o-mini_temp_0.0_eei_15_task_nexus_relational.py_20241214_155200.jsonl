Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to handle them correctly in subsequent operations.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may return empty lists or dictionaries if the input does not match any existing records. Always check the output before proceeding with further operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Calls**: When querying related information (e.g., user details, favorite foods), ensure that you first retrieve the necessary IDs or data points from previous function calls.\n\n4. **Testing and Validation**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, run test calls with known inputs to validate the expected outputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Keep track of any observations or peculiarities in function behavior for future reference, especially if certain inputs lead to unexpected results.\n\n6. **Function Usage**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for the correct usage patterns, argument types, and expected outputs.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If a query requires multiple pieces of information, break it down into smaller function calls to gather the necessary data step by step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are the favorite foods of Bob?\"\n   - Step 1: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(21)` to retrieve Bob's favorite food IDs.\n   - Step 2: For each food ID returned, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n   - Step 3: Compile the results to present Bob's favorite foods.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n   - Step 1: Call `get_current_weather_for_location(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n   - Step 2: Present the returned weather information directly.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"List all users and their favorite colors.\"\n   - Step 1: Call `list_user_ids()` to get all user IDs.\n   - Step 2: For each user ID, call `get_user_favorite_color(user_id)` to retrieve their favorite color.\n   - Step 3: Compile the results into a list of users and their favorite colors.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"What foods are available in the system?\"\n   - Step 1: Call `find_foods_by_name(\"\")` (or a specific food name) to retrieve all foods.\n   - Step 2: Present the list of foods returned.\n\nBy following these structured steps, future agents can efficiently navigate the functional environment and respond to user queries effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to handle them correctly in subsequent operations.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may return empty lists or dictionaries if the input does not match any existing records. Always check the output before proceeding with further operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Calls**: When querying related information (e.g., user details, favorite foods), ensure that you first retrieve the necessary IDs or data points from previous function calls.\n\n4. **Testing and Validation**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, run test calls with known inputs to validate the expected outputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Keep track of any observations or peculiarities in function behavior for future reference, especially if certain inputs lead to unexpected results.\n\n6. **Function Usage**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for the correct usage patterns, argument types, and expected outputs.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If a query requires multiple pieces of information, break it down into smaller function calls to gather the necessary data step by step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are the favorite foods of Bob?\"\n   - Step 1: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(21)` to retrieve Bob's favorite food IDs.\n   - Step 2: For each food ID returned, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n   - Step 3: Compile the results to present Bob's favorite foods.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n   - Step 1: Call `get_current_weather_for_location(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n   - Step 2: Present the returned weather information directly.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"List all users and their favorite colors.\"\n   - Step 1: Call `list_user_ids()` to get all user IDs.\n   - Step 2: For each user ID, call `get_user_favorite_color(user_id)` to retrieve their favorite color.\n   - Step 3: Compile the results into a list of users and their favorite colors.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"What foods are available in the system?\"\n   - Step 1: Call `find_foods_by_name(\"\")` (or a specific food name) to retrieve all foods.\n   - Step 2: Present the list of foods returned.\n\nBy following these structured steps, future agents can efficiently navigate the functional environment and respond to user queries effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to handle them correctly in subsequent operations.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may return empty lists or dictionaries if the input does not match any existing records. Always check the output before proceeding with further operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Calls**: When querying related information (e.g., user details, favorite foods), ensure that you first retrieve the necessary IDs or data points from previous function calls.\n\n4. **Testing and Validation**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, run test calls with known inputs to validate the expected outputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Keep track of any observations or peculiarities in function behavior for future reference, especially if certain inputs lead to unexpected results.\n\n6. **Function Usage**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for the correct usage patterns, argument types, and expected outputs.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If a query requires multiple pieces of information, break it down into smaller function calls to gather the necessary data step by step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are the favorite foods of Bob?\"\n   - Step 1: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(21)` to retrieve Bob's favorite food IDs.\n   - Step 2: For each food ID returned, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n   - Step 3: Compile the results to present Bob's favorite foods.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n   - Step 1: Call `get_current_weather_for_location(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n   - Step 2: Present the returned weather information directly.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"List all users and their favorite colors.\"\n   - Step 1: Call `list_user_ids()` to get all user IDs.\n   - Step 2: For each user ID, call `get_user_favorite_color(user_id)` to retrieve their favorite color.\n   - Step 3: Compile the results into a list of users and their favorite colors.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"What foods are available in the system?\"\n   - Step 1: Call `find_foods_by_name(\"\")` (or a specific food name) to retrieve all foods.\n   - Step 2: Present the list of foods returned.\n\nBy following these structured steps, future agents can efficiently navigate the functional environment and respond to user queries effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
