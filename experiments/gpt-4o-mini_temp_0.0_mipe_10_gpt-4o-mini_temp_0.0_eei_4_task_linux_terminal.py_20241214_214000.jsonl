answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found).

Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call.

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed).

Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found).

Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call.

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
