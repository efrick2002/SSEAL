File Operations:\n- write_next() and write_over() don't add newlines\n- match_it() is line-based and literal (no regex)\n- look_in() sorts alphabetically\n- view() preserves all bytes\n\n4. Testing Strategy:\n- Use look_back() to verify operations\n- Test with empty strings and special characters\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Check permissions with look_in(show_perm=True)\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most functions fail silently\n- destory() is strict about valid paths\n- mod_perms() requires exact permission format\n- callback() requires string arguments\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1.

Path Handling:\n- All functions normalize paths (multiple slashes, ./, ../)\n- Parent directories are created automatically when needed\n- Absolute and relative paths both work\n- No wildcard support\n\n2. Permissions:\n- super() may be needed for some operations\n- write operations ignore permissions\n- mod_perms() uses string format only\n- destory() needs recursive=True for directories\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next() and write_over() don't add newlines\n- match_it() is line-based and literal (no regex)\n- look_in() sorts alphabetically\n- view() preserves all bytes\n\n4. Testing Strategy:\n- Use look_back() to verify operations\n- Test with empty strings and special characters\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Check permissions with look_in(show_perm=True)\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most functions fail silently\n- destory() is strict about valid paths\n- mod_perms() requires exact permission format\n- callback() requires string arguments\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Break down complex operations into simple steps\n2. Verify each step with look_in() or view()\n3. Use look_back() to debug issues\n4. Consider permissions and path normalization\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of all text files containing 'important'\"\n```python\n# First find matching files\nwrite_over(\"test1.txt\", \"important data\")\nwrite_over(\"test2.txt\", \"other data\")\nwrite_over(\"test3.txt\", \"more important\")\nmatches = match_it(\"important\", \"test1.txt\", \"test2.txt\", \"test3.txt\")\n\n# Create backup directory\nlay_path(\"backup\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n# Copy matching files\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        write_over(f\"backup/{filename}\", content)\n\n# Verify backup\nlook_in(\"backup\", all=True)\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Set up a protected directory structure\"\n```python\n# Create directory structure\nlay_path(\"secure/private\", mode=\"dir\")\nwrite_over(\"secure/private/secret.txt\", \"classified\")\n\n# Lock down permissions\nmod_perms(\"r--r-----\", \"secure/private/secret.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-----\", \"secure/private\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-xr-x\", \"secure\")\n\n# Verify structure\nlook_in(\"secure\", all=True, show_perm=True)\nlook_in(\"secure/private\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find and replace text in files\"\n```python\n# First locate files\nwrite_over(\"doc1.txt\", \"color: blue\\nsize: large\")\nwrite_over(\"doc2.txt\", \"color: red\\ntype: square\")\nmatches = match_it(\"color:\", \"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n\n# Replace in each file\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        new_content = content.replace(\"color:\", \"colour:\")\n        write_over(filename, new_content)\n\n# Verify changes\nview(\"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Permissions:\n- super() may be needed for some operations\n- write operations ignore permissions\n- mod_perms() uses string format only\n- destory() needs recursive=True for directories\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next() and write_over() don't add newlines\n- match_it() is line-based and literal (no regex)\n- look_in() sorts alphabetically\n- view() preserves all bytes\n\n4. Testing Strategy:\n- Use look_back() to verify operations\n- Test with empty strings and special characters\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Check permissions with look_in(show_perm=True)\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most functions fail silently\n- destory() is strict about valid paths\n- mod_perms() requires exact permission format\n- callback() requires string arguments\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1.

Path Handling:\n- All functions normalize paths (multiple slashes, ./, ../)\n- Parent directories are created automatically when needed\n- Absolute and relative paths both work\n- No wildcard support\n\n2. Permissions:\n- super() may be needed for some operations\n- write operations ignore permissions\n- mod_perms() uses string format only\n- destory() needs recursive=True for directories\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next() and write_over() don't add newlines\n- match_it() is line-based and literal (no regex)\n- look_in() sorts alphabetically\n- view() preserves all bytes\n\n4. Testing Strategy:\n- Use look_back() to verify operations\n- Test with empty strings and special characters\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Check permissions with look_in(show_perm=True)\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most functions fail silently\n- destory() is strict about valid paths\n- mod_perms() requires exact permission format\n- callback() requires string arguments\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Break down complex operations into simple steps\n2. Verify each step with look_in() or view()\n3. Use look_back() to debug issues\n4. Consider permissions and path normalization\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of all text files containing 'important'\"\n```python\n# First find matching files\nwrite_over(\"test1.txt\", \"important data\")\nwrite_over(\"test2.txt\", \"other data\")\nwrite_over(\"test3.txt\", \"more important\")\nmatches = match_it(\"important\", \"test1.txt\", \"test2.txt\", \"test3.txt\")\n\n# Create backup directory\nlay_path(\"backup\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n# Copy matching files\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        write_over(f\"backup/{filename}\", content)\n\n# Verify backup\nlook_in(\"backup\", all=True)\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Set up a protected directory structure\"\n```python\n# Create directory structure\nlay_path(\"secure/private\", mode=\"dir\")\nwrite_over(\"secure/private/secret.txt\", \"classified\")\n\n# Lock down permissions\nmod_perms(\"r--r-----\", \"secure/private/secret.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-----\", \"secure/private\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-xr-x\", \"secure\")\n\n# Verify structure\nlook_in(\"secure\", all=True, show_perm=True)\nlook_in(\"secure/private\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find and replace text in files\"\n```python\n# First locate files\nwrite_over(\"doc1.txt\", \"color: blue\\nsize: large\")\nwrite_over(\"doc2.txt\", \"color: red\\ntype: square\")\nmatches = match_it(\"color:\", \"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n\n# Replace in each file\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        new_content = content.replace(\"color:\", \"colour:\")\n        write_over(filename, new_content)\n\n# Verify changes\nview(\"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Path Handling:\n- All functions normalize paths (multiple slashes, ./, ../)\n- Parent directories are created automatically when needed\n- Absolute and relative paths both work\n- No wildcard support\n\n2. Permissions:\n- super() may be needed for some operations\n- write operations ignore permissions\n- mod_perms() uses string format only\n- destory() needs recursive=True for directories\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next() and write_over() don't add newlines\n- match_it() is line-based and literal (no regex)\n- look_in() sorts alphabetically\n- view() preserves all bytes\n\n4. Testing Strategy:\n- Use look_back() to verify operations\n- Test with empty strings and special characters\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Check permissions with look_in(show_perm=True)\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most functions fail silently\n- destory() is strict about valid paths\n- mod_perms() requires exact permission format\n- callback() requires string arguments\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Break down complex operations into simple steps\n2. Verify each step with look_in() or view()\n3. Use look_back() to debug issues\n4. Consider permissions and path normalization\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of all text files containing 'important'\"\n```python\n# First find matching files\nwrite_over(\"test1.txt\", \"important data\")\nwrite_over(\"test2.txt\", \"other data\")\nwrite_over(\"test3.txt\", \"more important\")\nmatches = match_it(\"important\", \"test1.txt\", \"test2.txt\", \"test3.txt\")\n\n# Create backup directory\nlay_path(\"backup\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n# Copy matching files\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        write_over(f\"backup/{filename}\", content)\n\n# Verify backup\nlook_in(\"backup\", all=True)\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Set up a protected directory structure\"\n```python\n# Create directory structure\nlay_path(\"secure/private\", mode=\"dir\")\nwrite_over(\"secure/private/secret.txt\", \"classified\")\n\n# Lock down permissions\nmod_perms(\"r--r-----\", \"secure/private/secret.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-----\", \"secure/private\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-xr-x\", \"secure\")\n\n# Verify structure\nlook_in(\"secure\", all=True, show_perm=True)\nlook_in(\"secure/private\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find and replace text in files\"\n```python\n# First locate files\nwrite_over(\"doc1.txt\", \"color: blue\\nsize: large\")\nwrite_over(\"doc2.txt\", \"color: red\\ntype: square\")\nmatches = match_it(\"color:\", \"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n\n# Replace in each file\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        new_content = content.replace(\"color:\", \"colour:\")\n        write_over(filename, new_content)\n\n# Verify changes\nview(\"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Path Handling:\n- All functions normalize paths (multiple slashes, ./, ../)\n- Parent directories are created automatically when needed\n- Absolute and relative paths both work\n- No wildcard support\n\n2. Permissions:\n- super() may be needed for some operations\n- write operations ignore permissions\n- mod_perms() uses string format only\n- destory() needs recursive=True for directories\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next() and write_over() don't add newlines\n- match_it() is line-based and literal (no regex)\n- look_in() sorts alphabetically\n- view() preserves all bytes\n\n4. Testing Strategy:\n- Use look_back() to verify operations\n- Test with empty strings and special characters\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Check permissions with look_in(show_perm=True)\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most functions fail silently\n- destory() is strict about valid paths\n- mod_perms() requires exact permission format\n- callback() requires string arguments\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Break down complex operations into simple steps\n2. Verify each step with look_in() or view()\n3. Use look_back() to debug issues\n4. Consider permissions and path normalization\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of all text files containing 'important'\"\n```python\n# First find matching files\nwrite_over(\"test1.txt\", \"important data\")\nwrite_over(\"test2.txt\", \"other data\")\nwrite_over(\"test3.txt\", \"more important\")\nmatches = match_it(\"important\", \"test1.txt\", \"test2.txt\", \"test3.txt\")\n\n# Create backup directory\nlay_path(\"backup\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n# Copy matching files\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        write_over(f\"backup/{filename}\", content)\n\n# Verify backup\nlook_in(\"backup\", all=True)\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Set up a protected directory structure\"\n```python\n# Create directory structure\nlay_path(\"secure/private\", mode=\"dir\")\nwrite_over(\"secure/private/secret.txt\", \"classified\")\n\n# Lock down permissions\nmod_perms(\"r--r-----\", \"secure/private/secret.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-----\", \"secure/private\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-xr-x\", \"secure\")\n\n# Verify structure\nlook_in(\"secure\", all=True, show_perm=True)\nlook_in(\"secure/private\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find and replace text in files\"\n```python\n# First locate files\nwrite_over(\"doc1.txt\", \"color: blue\\nsize: large\")\nwrite_over(\"doc2.txt\", \"color: red\\ntype: square\")\nmatches = match_it(\"color:\", \"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n\n# Replace in each file\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        new_content = content.replace(\"color:\", \"colour:\")\n        write_over(filename, new_content)\n\n# Verify changes\nview(\"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n- All functions normalize paths (multiple slashes, ./, ../)\n- Parent directories are created automatically when needed\n- Absolute and relative paths both work\n- No wildcard support\n\n2. Permissions:\n- super() may be needed for some operations\n- write operations ignore permissions\n- mod_perms() uses string format only\n- destory() needs recursive=True for directories\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next() and write_over() don't add newlines\n- match_it() is line-based and literal (no regex)\n- look_in() sorts alphabetically\n- view() preserves all bytes\n\n4. Testing Strategy:\n- Use look_back() to verify operations\n- Test with empty strings and special characters\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Check permissions with look_in(show_perm=True)\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most functions fail silently\n- destory() is strict about valid paths\n- mod_perms() requires exact permission format\n- callback() requires string arguments\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Break down complex operations into simple steps\n2. Verify each step with look_in() or view()\n3. Use look_back() to debug issues\n4. Consider permissions and path normalization\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of all text files containing 'important'\"\n```python\n# First find matching files\nwrite_over(\"test1.txt\", \"important data\")\nwrite_over(\"test2.txt\", \"other data\")\nwrite_over(\"test3.txt\", \"more important\")\nmatches = match_it(\"important\", \"test1.txt\", \"test2.txt\", \"test3.txt\")\n\n# Create backup directory\nlay_path(\"backup\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n# Copy matching files\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        write_over(f\"backup/{filename}\", content)\n\n# Verify backup\nlook_in(\"backup\", all=True)\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Set up a protected directory structure\"\n```python\n# Create directory structure\nlay_path(\"secure/private\", mode=\"dir\")\nwrite_over(\"secure/private/secret.txt\", \"classified\")\n\n# Lock down permissions\nmod_perms(\"r--r-----\", \"secure/private/secret.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-----\", \"secure/private\")\nmod_perms(\"r-xr-xr-x\", \"secure\")\n\n# Verify structure\nlook_in(\"secure\", all=True, show_perm=True)\nlook_in(\"secure/private\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find and replace text in files\"\n```python\n# First locate files\nwrite_over(\"doc1.txt\", \"color: blue\\nsize: large\")\nwrite_over(\"doc2.txt\", \"color: red\\ntype: square\")\nmatches = match_it(\"color:\", \"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n\n# Replace in each file\nfor line in matches.split('\\n'):\n    if line:\n        filename = line.split(':')[0]\n        content = view(filename)\n        new_content = content.replace(\"color:\", \"colour:\")\n        write_over(filename, new_content)\n\n# Verify changes\nview(\"doc1.txt\", \"doc2.txt\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Permissions:\n- super() may be needed for some operations\n- write operations ignore permissions\n- mod_perms() uses string format only\n- destory() needs recursive=True for directories\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next() and write_over() don't add newlines\n- match_it() is line-based and literal (no regex)\n- look_in() sorts alphabetically\n- view() preserves all bytes\n\n4. Testing Strategy:\n- Use look_back() to verify operations\n- Test with empty strings and special characters\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Check permissions with look_in(show_perm=True)\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most functions fail silently\n- destory() is strict about valid paths\n- mod_perms() requires exact permission format\n- callback() requires string arguments\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Break down complex operations into simple steps\n2. Verify each step with look_in() or view()\n3. Use look_back() to debug issues\n4.

Testing Strategy:\n- Use look_back() to verify operations\n- Test with empty strings and special characters\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Check permissions with look_in(show_perm=True)\n\n5.
