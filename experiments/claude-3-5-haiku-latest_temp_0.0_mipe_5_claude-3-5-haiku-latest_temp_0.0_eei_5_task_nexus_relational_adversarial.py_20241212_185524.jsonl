Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Strategy:\n- Most functions require an integer ID as input\n- Always check for valid ID ranges (typically 1-5 for locations, 1-43 for users)\n- Some functions require iterable inputs (lists)\n- Functions often return dictionaries or lists with structured data\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Location IDs are linked to cities, times, and weather\n- User IDs have associated details like name, email, favorite color\n- Food IDs have nutritional and allergenic information\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid or unrecognized IDs typically return error messages\n- Some functions require specific input types (e.g., iterables)\n- Always validate inputs before calling functions\n\n4. Recommended Exploration:\n- Start by identifying the specific type of information needed\n- Use complementary functions to build a comprehensive view\n- Cross-reference data using different function calls\n\n5. Typical Workflow:\na) Identify the core query\nb) Determine relevant functions\nc) Make sequential function calls\nd) Combine and process results\ne) Handle potential error cases\n\nLimitations:\n- No persistent state between function calls\n- Limited error handling within the environment\n- Requires careful input validation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User Profile Retrieval\nQuery: \"Get details about user Alice\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Alice's user ID using z([]) \u2192 Identifies Alice's ID as 1\n2. Call f(1) to get full user details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n3. Additional context:\n   - Favorite color: n(1) \u2192 'red'\n   - Location details: g(1) \u2192 New York information\n   - Favorite foods: Use h() on [1, 2, 3]\n\nExample 2: Food Allergy Information\nQuery: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Pizza?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Pizza's ID using c([]) \u2192 Identifies Pizza's ID as 1\n2. Call h(1) to get food details\n   - Returns {'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}\n3. Confirm allergic ingredients: u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\nExample 3: Location Weather Query\nQuery: \"What's the weather in Miami?\"\n\nStep-by-step resolution:\n1. Find Miami's location ID using w(5) \u2192 Confirms Miami\n2. Get weather details: \n   - q(5) \u2192 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F'\n   - g(5) provides additional context about current time\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
