This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Sort the results from highest to lowest average salary\n\nLet me try a more straightforward approach:\n\n<function_list>\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'aggregate', 'args': {'df': result[0]['result'], 'group_by': 'team_id', 'agg_dict': {'salary': 'mean'}}},\n    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'df': result[1]['result'], 'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}}\n])\n</function_list>\n\nThis is similar to the previous attempt, but I'm ensuring I'm using the correct result from each step.\n\n<end_query>"

This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help avoid KeyErrors when trying to read or manipulate non-existent tables.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle various errors such as KeyError, NameError, and ValueError. These errors often arise from trying to access non-existent tables, columns, or invalid operations.\n\n3. **Sequential Operations**: When performing multiple operations, ensure that the output of one operation is valid input for the next. For example, if you read a DataFrame, ensure it is defined before trying to aggregate or manipulate it.\n\n4. **Use of Conditions**: When using the `select` function, ensure that the conditions provided are valid and correspond to existing columns in the DataFrame.\n\n5. **Testing Expressions**: When using `calculate_column`, test expressions in isolation to ensure they are valid Python expressions before using them in the function.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of arguments, return types, and examples to avoid confusion.\n\n7. **Iterative Exploration**: If you encounter issues, iteratively explore the environment by checking available tables and their structures before performing complex operations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the environment more effectively and avoid common pitfalls encountered during exploration.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I want to see the total points scored by each player.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the points by player ID using `aggregate(player_stats_df, 'player_id', {'points': 'sum'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I calculate the average salary of coaches?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the coaches table using `read_db('coaches')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Aggregate the salary by team ID using `aggregate(coaches_df, 'team_id', {'salary': 'mean'})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the aggregated DataFrame.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to find players with more than 20 points.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Check available tables using `ls()`.\n   - **Step 2**: Read the player statistics table using `read_db('player_statistics')`.\n   - **Step 3**: Select players with points greater than 20 using `select(player_stats_df, columns=['player_id', 'points'], conditions={'points': ('>', 20)})`.\n   - **Step 4**: Return the filtered DataFrame.\n\nBy following these examples, future agents can effectively address user queries and navigate the functional environment with confidence.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
