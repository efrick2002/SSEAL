The `destory()` function has optional parameters:\n   - `recursive`: to delete directory and its contents\n   - `force`: to force deletion without confirmation\n\n4. Since we want to delete a directory, I'll use `recursive=True` to ensure all contents are deleted\n\nHere's the function call:\n\n<function_list>\ndestory('tempdir', recursive=True)\n</function_list>\n\nThis function call will attempt to delete the 'tempdir' directory and all its contents. The `recursive=True` parameter ensures that if the directory is not empty, it will still be deleted completely."
