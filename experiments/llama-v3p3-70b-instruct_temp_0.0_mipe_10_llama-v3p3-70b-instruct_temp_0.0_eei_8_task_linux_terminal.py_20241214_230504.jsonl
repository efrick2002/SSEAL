The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

But since we are limited to just calling functions, the above approach is the closest we can get. \n\nAlso, note that the view function may return an error message if the file 'key.txt' does not exist. In this case, the export_env function call will fail because it will be trying to set the environment variable 'THE_KEY' to an error message. \n\nTherefore, in a real-world scenario, you would want to add error checking code to handle this situation.

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Then we can use the following function calls:\n\n<function_list>\nview('notes.txt')\nexport_env('SECRET_COUNT', '5')\n</function_list>\n\nPlease note that the above function calls are based on the assumption that we have a way to parse the output of view('notes.txt') and count the lines containing 'secret'. \n\nIn a real-world scenario, we would need to use a programming language to parse the output of view('notes.txt') and count the lines containing 'secret', and then use the export_env function to set the environment variable 'SECRET_COUNT' to the count. \n\nFor example, in Python, we could use the following code:\n\n```\nimport re\n\ndef count_secret_lines(file_name):\n    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:\n        lines = file.readlines()\n        count = sum(1 for line in lines if 'secret' in line)\n        return count\n\ncount = count_secret_lines('notes.txt')\nexport_env('SECRET_COUNT', str(count))\n```\n\nThis code opens the 'notes.txt' file, reads all lines, counts the lines containing 'secret', and then sets the environment variable 'SECRET_COUNT' to the count. \n\nAgain, please note that the above code is just an example and may not work in the given environment. The given environment seems to be a simulated environment and may not support all the functions and operations that a real-world environment would support."

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1.

Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `write_next` and `write_over` functions can be used to modify the contents of files, and the `mod_perms` function can be used to set the permissions of files and directories. The `move_it` function can be used to move files and directories, and the `destory` function can be used to delete files and directories. The `export_env` function can be used to set environment variables, and the `look_back` function can be used to view the history of previous commands. The `super` function is unknown and should be used with caution.\n\nIt is also recommended to use the `match_it` function to search for files matching a specific pattern, and the `callback` function to concatenate strings.\n\nWhen using these functions, it is important to pay attention to the error messages and return values, as they can provide valuable information about the success or failure of the operation.\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to start with simple operations and gradually build up to more complex ones, using the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing the contents of the current directory and displaying the contents of a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents of the current directory.\n2. Call `view('file.txt')` to display the contents of the file `file.txt`.\n\nExample 2: Modifying the contents of a file and setting its permissions.\n\n1. Call `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to append the string `Hello World!` to the end of the file `file.txt`.\n2. Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', 'file.txt')` to set the permissions of the file `file.txt` to `rwxr-xr-x`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a different directory and deleting a file.\n\n1. Call `move_it('file.txt', 'destination_directory')` to move the file `file.txt` to the directory `destination_directory`.\n2. Call `destory('file.txt', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the file `file.txt` and all its contents.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions in this environment to perform common operations, and how to use the `look_back` function to keep track of the history of previous commands.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.
