Function Call Methodology:\n   - Always use the <function_list> tag when submitting function calls\n   - Expect results as a list of dictionaries with 'call' and 'result' keys\n   - Be prepared for potential exceptions and error handling\n\n2. Key Observations:\n   - Path handling is strict and requires precise specification\n   - Many functions have specific mode or argument requirements\n   - Error messages are crucial for understanding function constraints\n\n3. Debugging Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument function calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases and complex scenarios\n   - Pay attention to error messages to understand function limitations\n   - Use look_back() to review previous command history\n\n4. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Methodology:\n   - Always use the <function_list> tag when submitting function calls\n   - Expect results as a list of dictionaries with 'call' and 'result' keys\n   - Be prepared for potential exceptions and error handling\n\n2. Key Observations:\n   - Path handling is strict and requires precise specification\n   - Many functions have specific mode or argument requirements\n   - Error messages are crucial for understanding function constraints\n\n3. Debugging Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument function calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases and complex scenarios\n   - Pay attention to error messages to understand function limitations\n   - Use look_back() to review previous command history\n\n4. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Key Observations:\n   - Path handling is strict and requires precise specification\n   - Many functions have specific mode or argument requirements\n   - Error messages are crucial for understanding function constraints\n\n3. Debugging Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument function calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases and complex scenarios\n   - Pay attention to error messages to understand function limitations\n   - Use look_back() to review previous command history\n\n4. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Methodology:\n   - Always use the <function_list> tag when submitting function calls\n   - Expect results as a list of dictionaries with 'call' and 'result' keys\n   - Be prepared for potential exceptions and error handling\n\n2. Key Observations:\n   - Path handling is strict and requires precise specification\n   - Many functions have specific mode or argument requirements\n   - Error messages are crucial for understanding function constraints\n\n3. Debugging Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument function calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases and complex scenarios\n   - Pay attention to error messages to understand function limitations\n   - Use look_back() to review previous command history\n\n4. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Methodology:\n   - Always use the <function_list> tag when submitting function calls\n   - Expect results as a list of dictionaries with 'call' and 'result' keys\n   - Be prepared for potential exceptions and error handling\n\n2. Key Observations:\n   - Path handling is strict and requires precise specification\n   - Many functions have specific mode or argument requirements\n   - Error messages are crucial for understanding function constraints\n\n3. Debugging Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument function calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases and complex scenarios\n   - Pay attention to error messages to understand function limitations\n   - Use look_back() to review previous command history\n\n4. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Methodology:\n   - Always use the <function_list> tag when submitting function calls\n   - Expect results as a list of dictionaries with 'call' and 'result' keys\n   - Be prepared for potential exceptions and error handling\n\n2. Key Observations:\n   - Path handling is strict and requires precise specification\n   - Many functions have specific mode or argument requirements\n   - Error messages are crucial for understanding function constraints\n\n3. Debugging Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument function calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases and complex scenarios\n   - Pay attention to error messages to understand function limitations\n   - Use look_back() to review previous command history\n\n4. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Methodology:\n   - Always use the <function_list> tag when submitting function calls\n   - Expect results as a list of dictionaries with 'call' and 'result' keys\n   - Be prepared for potential exceptions and error handling\n\n2. Key Observations:\n   - Path handling is strict and requires precise specification\n   - Many functions have specific mode or argument requirements\n   - Error messages are crucial for understanding function constraints\n\n3. Debugging Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument function calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases and complex scenarios\n   - Pay attention to error messages to understand function limitations\n   - Use look_back() to review previous command history\n\n4. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Methodology:\n   - Always use the <function_list> tag when submitting function calls\n   - Expect results as a list of dictionaries with 'call' and 'result' keys\n   - Be prepared for potential exceptions and error handling\n\n2. Key Observations:\n   - Path handling is strict and requires precise specification\n   - Many functions have specific mode or argument requirements\n   - Error messages are crucial for understanding function constraints\n\n3. Debugging Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument function calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases and complex scenarios\n   - Pay attention to error messages to understand function limitations\n   - Use look_back() to review previous command history\n\n4. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Call Methodology:\n   - Always use the <function_list> tag when submitting function calls\n   - Expect results as a list of dictionaries with 'call' and 'result' keys\n   - Be prepared for potential exceptions and error handling\n\n2. Key Observations:\n   - Path handling is strict and requires precise specification\n   - Many functions have specific mode or argument requirements\n   - Error messages are crucial for understanding function constraints\n\n3. Debugging Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument function calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases and complex scenarios\n   - Pay attention to error messages to understand function limitations\n   - Use look_back() to review previous command history\n\n4. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Avoid assumptions about function behavior\n   - Always verify path existence before operations\n   - Check for specific mode requirements\n   - Handle potential permission and directory issues\n\n5. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with simple, low-risk function calls\n   - Incrementally increase complexity\n   - Document unexpected behaviors\n   - Use error messages to guide further investigation\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario 1: File Management\nUser Query: \"Create a new script, make it executable, and then view its contents\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Write script content:\n   write_over('/tmp/example_script.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"Hello, World!\"')\n\n2. Modify permissions:\n   mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\n3. View script contents:\n   view('/tmp/example_script.sh')\n\nExample Scenario 2: Environment Configuration\nUser Query: \"Set a debug flag, check current environment, and review recent commands\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Export debug variable:\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n\n2. Check current directory contents:\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n3. Review command history:\n   look_back()\n\nExample Scenario 3: File Matching and Manipulation\nUser Query: \"Find all text files, move them to a new directory\"\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n1. Create destination directory:\n   lay_path('/tmp/text_files', mode='file')\n\n2. Match text files:\n   match_it('*.txt')\n\n3. Move matching files:\n   move_it('*.txt', '/tmp/text_files')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
