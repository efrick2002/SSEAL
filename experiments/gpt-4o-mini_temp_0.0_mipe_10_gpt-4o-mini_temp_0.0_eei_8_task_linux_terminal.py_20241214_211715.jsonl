Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential error cases for each function. For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs. This will help clarify any ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations. For example, you cannot move a file that does not exist. Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met before calling dependent functions.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the current state of the environment, such as existing files and their contents, to make informed decisions about which functions to call.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Use of Wildcards**: When using the `match_it` function, be mindful of the patterns you provide. Wildcards can help match multiple files, but ensure that the files exist in the specified paths.\n\n8. **Permissions**: When modifying permissions or deleting files, ensure that you have the necessary rights to perform these actions.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_over('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'This is my new file content.')` to write content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the contents of all text files in the /tmp directory?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to list all files in the directory.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the text files from the output.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/identified_text_file.txt')` for each text file to display their contents.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to delete a file but I am not sure if I have permission.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to check the files and their permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: If the file is found, call `destory('/tmp/file_to_delete.txt', force=True)` to delete it, assuming you have the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"How do I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('755', '/tmp/file_to_change_permissions.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the permissions have been updated.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents can effectively navigate and utilize the functional environment to address user queries efficiently. \n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential error cases for each function. For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs. This will help clarify any ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations. For example, you cannot move a file that does not exist. Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met before calling dependent functions.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the current state of the environment, such as existing files and their contents, to make informed decisions about which functions to call.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Use of Wildcards**: When using the `match_it` function, be mindful of the patterns you provide. Wildcards can help match multiple files, but ensure that the files exist in the specified paths.\n\n8. **Permissions**: When modifying permissions or deleting files, ensure that you have the necessary rights to perform these actions.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_over('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'This is my new file content.')` to write content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the contents of all text files in the /tmp directory?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to list all files in the directory.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the text files from the output.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/identified_text_file.txt')` for each text file to display their contents.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to delete a file but I am not sure if I have permission.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to check the files and their permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: If the file is found, call `destory('/tmp/file_to_delete.txt', force=True)` to delete it, assuming you have the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"How do I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('755', '/tmp/file_to_change_permissions.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the permissions have been updated.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents can effectively navigate and utilize the functional environment to address user queries efficiently. \n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential error cases for each function. For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs.

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential error cases for each function. For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs. This will help clarify any ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations. For example, you cannot move a file that does not exist. Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met before calling dependent functions.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the current state of the environment, such as existing files and their contents, to make informed decisions about which functions to call.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Use of Wildcards**: When using the `match_it` function, be mindful of the patterns you provide. Wildcards can help match multiple files, but ensure that the files exist in the specified paths.\n\n8. **Permissions**: When modifying permissions or deleting files, ensure that you have the necessary rights to perform these actions.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_over('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'This is my new file content.')` to write content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the contents of all text files in the /tmp directory?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to list all files in the directory.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the text files from the output.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/identified_text_file.txt')` for each text file to display their contents.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to delete a file but I am not sure if I have permission.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to check the files and their permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: If the file is found, call `destory('/tmp/file_to_delete.txt', force=True)` to delete it, assuming you have the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"How do I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('755', '/tmp/file_to_change_permissions.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the permissions have been updated.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents can effectively navigate and utilize the functional environment to address user queries efficiently. \n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs. This will help clarify any ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations. For example, you cannot move a file that does not exist. Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met before calling dependent functions.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the current state of the environment, such as existing files and their contents, to make informed decisions about which functions to call.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Use of Wildcards**: When using the `match_it` function, be mindful of the patterns you provide. Wildcards can help match multiple files, but ensure that the files exist in the specified paths.\n\n8. **Permissions**: When modifying permissions or deleting files, ensure that you have the necessary rights to perform these actions.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_over('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'This is my new file content.')` to write content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the contents of all text files in the /tmp directory?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to list all files in the directory.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the text files from the output.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/identified_text_file.txt')` for each text file to display their contents.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to delete a file but I am not sure if I have permission.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to check the files and their permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: If the file is found, call `destory('/tmp/file_to_delete.txt', force=True)` to delete it, assuming you have the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"How do I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('755', '/tmp/file_to_change_permissions.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the permissions have been updated.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents can effectively navigate and utilize the functional environment to address user queries efficiently. \n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential error cases for each function. For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs. This will help clarify any ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations. For example, you cannot move a file that does not exist. Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met before calling dependent functions.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the current state of the environment, such as existing files and their contents, to make informed decisions about which functions to call.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Use of Wildcards**: When using the `match_it` function, be mindful of the patterns you provide. Wildcards can help match multiple files, but ensure that the files exist in the specified paths.\n\n8. **Permissions**: When modifying permissions or deleting files, ensure that you have the necessary rights to perform these actions.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_over('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'This is my new file content.')` to write content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the contents of all text files in the /tmp directory?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to list all files in the directory.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the text files from the output.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/identified_text_file.txt')` for each text file to display their contents.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to delete a file but I am not sure if I have permission.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to check the files and their permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: If the file is found, call `destory('/tmp/file_to_delete.txt', force=True)` to delete it, assuming you have the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"How do I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('755', '/tmp/file_to_change_permissions.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the permissions have been updated.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents can effectively navigate and utilize the functional environment to address user queries efficiently. \n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential error cases for each function. For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs. This will help clarify any ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations. For example, you cannot move a file that does not exist. Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met before calling dependent functions.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the current state of the environment, such as existing files and their contents, to make informed decisions about which functions to call.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Use of Wildcards**: When using the `match_it` function, be mindful of the patterns you provide. Wildcards can help match multiple files, but ensure that the files exist in the specified paths.\n\n8. **Permissions**: When modifying permissions or deleting files, ensure that you have the necessary rights to perform these actions.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_over('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'This is my new file content.')` to write content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the contents of all text files in the /tmp directory?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to list all files in the directory.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the text files from the output.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/identified_text_file.txt')` for each text file to display their contents.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to delete a file but I am not sure if I have permission.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to check the files and their permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: If the file is found, call `destory('/tmp/file_to_delete.txt', force=True)` to delete it, assuming you have the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"How do I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('755', '/tmp/file_to_change_permissions.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the permissions have been updated.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents can effectively navigate and utilize the functional environment to address user queries efficiently. \n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential error cases for each function. For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs. This will help clarify any ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations. For example, you cannot move a file that does not exist. Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met before calling dependent functions.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the current state of the environment, such as existing files and their contents, to make informed decisions about which functions to call.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Use of Wildcards**: When using the `match_it` function, be mindful of the patterns you provide. Wildcards can help match multiple files, but ensure that the files exist in the specified paths.\n\n8. **Permissions**: When modifying permissions or deleting files, ensure that you have the necessary rights to perform these actions.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_over('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'This is my new file content.')` to write content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the contents of all text files in the /tmp directory?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to list all files in the directory.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the text files from the output.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/identified_text_file.txt')` for each text file to display their contents.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to delete a file but I am not sure if I have permission.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to check the files and their permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: If the file is found, call `destory('/tmp/file_to_delete.txt', force=True)` to delete it, assuming you have the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"How do I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('755', '/tmp/file_to_change_permissions.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the permissions have been updated.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents can effectively navigate and utilize the functional environment to address user queries efficiently. \n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential error cases for each function. For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs. This will help clarify any ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations. For example, you cannot move a file that does not exist. Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met before calling dependent functions.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the current state of the environment, such as existing files and their contents, to make informed decisions about which functions to call.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Use of Wildcards**: When using the `match_it` function, be mindful of the patterns you provide. Wildcards can help match multiple files, but ensure that the files exist in the specified paths.\n\n8. **Permissions**: When modifying permissions or deleting files, ensure that you have the necessary rights to perform these actions.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_over('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'This is my new file content.')` to write content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the contents of all text files in the /tmp directory?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to list all files in the directory.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the text files from the output.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/identified_text_file.txt')` for each text file to display their contents.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to delete a file but I am not sure if I have permission.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to check the files and their permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: If the file is found, call `destory('/tmp/file_to_delete.txt', force=True)` to delete it, assuming you have the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"How do I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('755', '/tmp/file_to_change_permissions.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the permissions have been updated.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents can effectively navigate and utilize the functional environment to address user queries efficiently. \n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential error cases for each function. For example, attempting to delete a file without the necessary permissions will result in a permission denied error.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform test calls with known inputs and observe the outputs. This will help clarify any ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations. For example, you cannot move a file that does not exist. Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met before calling dependent functions.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the current state of the environment, such as existing files and their contents, to make informed decisions about which functions to call.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Use of Wildcards**: When using the `match_it` function, be mindful of the patterns you provide. Wildcards can help match multiple files, but ensure that the files exist in the specified paths.\n\n8. **Permissions**: When modifying permissions or deleting files, ensure that you have the necessary rights to perform these actions.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_over('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'This is my new file content.')` to write content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the contents of all text files in the /tmp directory?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to list all files in the directory.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the text files from the output.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/identified_text_file.txt')` for each text file to display their contents.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to delete a file but I am not sure if I have permission.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to check the files and their permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: If the file is found, call `destory('/tmp/file_to_delete.txt', force=True)` to delete it, assuming you have the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"How do I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('755', '/tmp/file_to_change_permissions.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the permissions have been updated.\n\nBy following these examples and guidelines, future agents can effectively navigate and utilize the functional environment to address user queries efficiently. \n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
