You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome.

You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can interact with it by calling the provided functions, which allow you to create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. The environment operates sequentially, executing each function call in the order it's received. The output of each function call is returned as a string or an exception if an error occurs. Keep in mind the following:\n\n1. **File System:** The environment has a basic file system. You can create files and directories within the environment. Paths are relative to the environment's root directory.\n2. **Permissions:**  File permissions can be modified using `mod_perms`, but the `force` argument in `destory` does not seem to bypass permission restrictions. The `super` function is present but does not seem to provide elevated privileges. It's unclear how to perform actions requiring root privileges.\n3. **Environment Variables:**  You can set environment variables using `export_env`, but it's unclear how to access or use these variables within the environment.\n4. **State:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Changes made by one function call (e.g., creating a file) will persist for subsequent calls.\n5. **Error Handling:**  Functions will raise exceptions if they encounter errors (e.g., trying to delete a non-existent file). Pay attention to these exceptions to understand why a function call failed.\n6. **Exploration:**  When presented with a new environment, it's crucial to systematically explore the available functions to understand their behavior and limitations. Start with simple calls, vary the arguments, and observe the outputs and any exceptions raised.\n\nTo answer user queries, you need to decompose the query into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use the function documentation above as a guide. Test your function calls thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"my_docs\", create a file inside it named \"notes.txt\", write \"Hello, world!\" to the file, and then display the contents of the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"my_docs\", mode=\"dir\")\nlay_path(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"my_docs/notes.txt\", \"Hello, world!\\n\")\nview(\"my_docs/notes.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the root directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all files within the \"logs\" directory.\n\n<function_list>\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"logs/log1.txt\", \"logs/log2.txt\") # Assuming these log files exist\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 4 (Illustrative Failure):** Attempt to delete a read-only directory.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"protected_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"protected_dir\") # Make it read-only\ndestory(\"protected_dir\") # This will likely raise an exception because it's a directory\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", force=True) # This will also likely raise an exception, as force doesn't seem to work on directories in this environment.\ndestory(\"protected_dir\", recursive=True) # This should work, even though the directory is read-only.\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
