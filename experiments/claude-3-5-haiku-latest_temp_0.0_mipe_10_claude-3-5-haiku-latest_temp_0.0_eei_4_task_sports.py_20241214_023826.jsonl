Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Bulls (Chicago) - $128,000,000\n\nThe data shows the team names, their cities, annual budgets, and includes the players on each team. The Warriors have the highest annual budget at $165 million, with players like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.\n\nSince the query has been fully addressed and the data has been processed as requested, I'll output:\n\n<end_query>"

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by calling ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before complex operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Combine functions using execute_operations() for complex queries\n- Use select() for filtering\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related data\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use calculate_column() for derived metrics\n\n4. Error Handling\n- Always check for KeyErrors when referencing tables or columns\n- Be prepared for potential division by zero or type conversion issues\n- Test complex expressions incrementally\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n- Use limit() to preview large datasets\n- Chain operations efficiently\n- Select only necessary columns to reduce computational overhead\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Identify available tables\nb) Understand table relationships\nc) Retrieve and inspect data\nd) Apply filters and transformations\ne) Aggregate or merge as needed\nf) Perform final calculations or selections\n\nKey Databases:\n- player.tbl: Player information\n- teams.tbl: Team details\n- coach.tbl: Coach information\n- team_stats.tbl: Team performance metrics\n- player_states.tbl: Player performance statistics\n\nInterconnection: Most tables linked by team_id or player_id\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries Across Teams\n\nUser Query: \"Which teams have the highest average player salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player data\n```python\nread_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Aggregate salaries by team\n```python\naggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team names for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), \n        group_by='team_id', \n        agg_dict={'salary': ['mean', 'max']}\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Finding Top Performing Young Players\n\nUser Query: \"Who are the top 3 young players (under 30) with the highest salaries?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Select young players\n```python\nselect(read_db('player.tbl'), \n    conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n)\n```\n\n2. Sort and limit results\n```python\nlimit(\n    sort(\n        select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n            conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n        ),\n        columns='salary',\n        ascending=False\n    ),\n    n=3\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with team information for context\n```python\nmerge_tables(\n    limit(\n        sort(\n            select(read_db('player.tbl'), \n                conditions={'age': ('<', 30)}\n            ),\n            columns='salary',\n            ascending=False\n        ),\n        n=3\n    ),\n    read_db('teams.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate the flexible, composable nature of the function environment, showing how complex queries can be constructed by chaining simple operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
