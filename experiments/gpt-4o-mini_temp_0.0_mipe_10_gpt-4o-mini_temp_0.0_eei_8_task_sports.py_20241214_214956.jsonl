This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
