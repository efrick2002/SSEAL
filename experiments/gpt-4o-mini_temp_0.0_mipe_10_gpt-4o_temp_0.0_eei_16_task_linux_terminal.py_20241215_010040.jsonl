interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to ensure that the paths and files you are working with exist. Many functions depend on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not exist. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Path Verification:** Before performing operations like viewing, moving, or modifying permissions, verify that the file or directory exists using `look_in()`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** Use `export_env()` to set environment variables, which can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n3. **Command History:** Use `look_back()` to understand the sequence of operations that have been performed, which can help in debugging or understanding the current state of the environment.\n\n4. **File and Directory Management:** Use `lay_path()` to create files or directories, and `destory()` to remove them. Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create the file: `lay_path('/tmp/example_file')`\n  2. Write content: `write_over('/tmp/example_file', 'Hello, World!')`\n  3. Read content: `view('/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 2: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Move a file to a new location.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Move the file: `move_it('/tmp/example_file', '/tmp/new_location/example_file')`\n\n**Example 3: Changing File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Change the permissions of a file to be executable.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Change permissions: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 4: Deleting a Directory**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Delete a directory and all its contents.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the directory exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Delete the directory: `destory('/tmp/example_dir', recursive=True, force=True)`\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to ensure that the paths and files you are working with exist. Many functions depend on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not exist. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Path Verification:** Before performing operations like viewing, moving, or modifying permissions, verify that the file or directory exists using `look_in()`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** Use `export_env()` to set environment variables, which can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n3. **Command History:** Use `look_back()` to understand the sequence of operations that have been performed, which can help in debugging or understanding the current state of the environment.\n\n4. **File and Directory Management:** Use `lay_path()` to create files or directories, and `destory()` to remove them. Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create the file: `lay_path('/tmp/example_file')`\n  2. Write content: `write_over('/tmp/example_file', 'Hello, World!')`\n  3. Read content: `view('/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 2: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Move a file to a new location.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Move the file: `move_it('/tmp/example_file', '/tmp/new_location/example_file')`\n\n**Example 3: Changing File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Change the permissions of a file to be executable.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Change permissions: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 4: Deleting a Directory**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Delete a directory and all its contents.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the directory exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Delete the directory: `destory('/tmp/example_dir', recursive=True, force=True)`\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to ensure that the paths and files you are working with exist. Many functions depend on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not exist. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Path Verification:** Before performing operations like viewing, moving, or modifying permissions, verify that the file or directory exists using `look_in()`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** Use `export_env()` to set environment variables, which can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n3. **Command History:** Use `look_back()` to understand the sequence of operations that have been performed, which can help in debugging or understanding the current state of the environment.\n\n4. **File and Directory Management:** Use `lay_path()` to create files or directories, and `destory()` to remove them. Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create the file: `lay_path('/tmp/example_file')`\n  2. Write content: `write_over('/tmp/example_file', 'Hello, World!')`\n  3. Read content: `view('/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 2: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Move a file to a new location.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Move the file: `move_it('/tmp/example_file', '/tmp/new_location/example_file')`\n\n**Example 3: Changing File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Change the permissions of a file to be executable.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Change permissions: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 4: Deleting a Directory**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Delete a directory and all its contents.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the directory exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Delete the directory: `destory('/tmp/example_dir', recursive=True, force=True)`\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to ensure that the paths and files you are working with exist. Many functions depend on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not exist. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Path Verification:** Before performing operations like viewing, moving, or modifying permissions, verify that the file or directory exists using `look_in()`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** Use `export_env()` to set environment variables, which can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n3. **Command History:** Use `look_back()` to understand the sequence of operations that have been performed, which can help in debugging or understanding the current state of the environment.\n\n4. **File and Directory Management:** Use `lay_path()` to create files or directories, and `destory()` to remove them. Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create the file: `lay_path('/tmp/example_file')`\n  2. Write content: `write_over('/tmp/example_file', 'Hello, World!')`\n  3. Read content: `view('/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 2: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Move a file to a new location.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Move the file: `move_it('/tmp/example_file', '/tmp/new_location/example_file')`\n\n**Example 3: Changing File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Change the permissions of a file to be executable.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Change permissions: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 4: Deleting a Directory**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Delete a directory and all its contents.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the directory exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Delete the directory: `destory('/tmp/example_dir', recursive=True, force=True)`\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to ensure that the paths and files you are working with exist. Many functions depend on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not exist. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Path Verification:** Before performing operations like viewing, moving, or modifying permissions, verify that the file or directory exists using `look_in()`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** Use `export_env()` to set environment variables, which can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n3. **Command History:** Use `look_back()` to understand the sequence of operations that have been performed, which can help in debugging or understanding the current state of the environment.\n\n4. **File and Directory Management:** Use `lay_path()` to create files or directories, and `destory()` to remove them. Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create the file: `lay_path('/tmp/example_file')`\n  2. Write content: `write_over('/tmp/example_file', 'Hello, World!')`\n  3. Read content: `view('/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 2: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Move a file to a new location.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Move the file: `move_it('/tmp/example_file', '/tmp/new_location/example_file')`\n\n**Example 3: Changing File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Change the permissions of a file to be executable.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Change permissions: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 4: Deleting a Directory**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Delete a directory and all its contents.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the directory exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Delete the directory: `destory('/tmp/example_dir', recursive=True, force=True)`\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1.

interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to ensure that the paths and files you are working with exist. Many functions depend on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not exist. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Path Verification:** Before performing operations like viewing, moving, or modifying permissions, verify that the file or directory exists using `look_in()`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** Use `export_env()` to set environment variables, which can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n3. **Command History:** Use `look_back()` to understand the sequence of operations that have been performed, which can help in debugging or understanding the current state of the environment.\n\n4. **File and Directory Management:** Use `lay_path()` to create files or directories, and `destory()` to remove them. Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create the file: `lay_path('/tmp/example_file')`\n  2. Write content: `write_over('/tmp/example_file', 'Hello, World!')`\n  3. Read content: `view('/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 2: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Move a file to a new location.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Move the file: `move_it('/tmp/example_file', '/tmp/new_location/example_file')`\n\n**Example 3: Changing File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Change the permissions of a file to be executable.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Change permissions: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 4: Deleting a Directory**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Delete a directory and all its contents.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the directory exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Delete the directory: `destory('/tmp/example_dir', recursive=True, force=True)`\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to ensure that the paths and files you are working with exist. Many functions depend on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not exist. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Path Verification:** Before performing operations like viewing, moving, or modifying permissions, verify that the file or directory exists using `look_in()`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** Use `export_env()` to set environment variables, which can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n3. **Command History:** Use `look_back()` to understand the sequence of operations that have been performed, which can help in debugging or understanding the current state of the environment.\n\n4. **File and Directory Management:** Use `lay_path()` to create files or directories, and `destory()` to remove them. Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create the file: `lay_path('/tmp/example_file')`\n  2. Write content: `write_over('/tmp/example_file', 'Hello, World!')`\n  3. Read content: `view('/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 2: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Move a file to a new location.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Move the file: `move_it('/tmp/example_file', '/tmp/new_location/example_file')`\n\n**Example 3: Changing File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Change the permissions of a file to be executable.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Change permissions: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 4: Deleting a Directory**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Delete a directory and all its contents.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the directory exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Delete the directory: `destory('/tmp/example_dir', recursive=True, force=True)`\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to ensure that the paths and files you are working with exist. Many functions depend on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not exist. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Path Verification:** Before performing operations like viewing, moving, or modifying permissions, verify that the file or directory exists using `look_in()`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** Use `export_env()` to set environment variables, which can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n3. **Command History:** Use `look_back()` to understand the sequence of operations that have been performed, which can help in debugging or understanding the current state of the environment.\n\n4. **File and Directory Management:** Use `lay_path()` to create files or directories, and `destory()` to remove them. Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create the file: `lay_path('/tmp/example_file')`\n  2. Write content: `write_over('/tmp/example_file', 'Hello, World!')`\n  3. Read content: `view('/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 2: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Move a file to a new location.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Move the file: `move_it('/tmp/example_file', '/tmp/new_location/example_file')`\n\n**Example 3: Changing File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Change the permissions of a file to be executable.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Change permissions: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 4: Deleting a Directory**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Delete a directory and all its contents.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the directory exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Delete the directory: `destory('/tmp/example_dir', recursive=True, force=True)`\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to ensure that the paths and files you are working with exist. Many functions depend on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not exist. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Path Verification:** Before performing operations like viewing, moving, or modifying permissions, verify that the file or directory exists using `look_in()`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:** Use `export_env()` to set environment variables, which can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n3. **Command History:** Use `look_back()` to understand the sequence of operations that have been performed, which can help in debugging or understanding the current state of the environment.\n\n4. **File and Directory Management:** Use `lay_path()` to create files or directories, and `destory()` to remove them. Ensure the correct mode is specified for `lay_path()`.\n\n5. **Permissions and Privileges:** Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions and `super()` for operations requiring elevated privileges.\n\n6. **Content Management:** Use `write_next()` and `write_over()` to manage file content, and `view()` to read it.\n\nWhen answering user queries, start by understanding the task and identifying the necessary functions. Verify the existence of paths and files before performing operations, and use the history to track changes.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Creating and Managing a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Create a file, write content to it, and then read the content.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Create the file: `lay_path('/tmp/example_file')`\n  2. Write content: `write_over('/tmp/example_file', 'Hello, World!')`\n  3. Read content: `view('/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 2: Moving a File**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Move a file to a new location.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Move the file: `move_it('/tmp/example_file', '/tmp/new_location/example_file')`\n\n**Example 3: Changing File Permissions**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Change the permissions of a file to be executable.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the file exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Change permissions: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/example_file')`\n\n**Example 4: Deleting a Directory**\n\n- **User Query:** \"Delete a directory and all its contents.\"\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Verify the directory exists: `look_in('/tmp')`\n  2. Delete the directory: `destory('/tmp/example_dir', recursive=True, force=True)`\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
