You can create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. Key learnings:\n\n1. **`super()` is essential:**  Many operations, especially those involving file system modifications (like `destory` and `mod_perms`), require elevated privileges. Always call `super()` before attempting such operations. It appears to be a toggle, so you don't need to call it repeatedly.\n\n2. **Error Handling:** The environment provides limited error messages. Pay close attention to the output to understand if an operation failed and why.\n\n3. **State Persistence:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Files created, modified, or deleted will persist until explicitly changed or the environment is reset.\n\n4. **Pathing:**  The environment uses a standard file system pathing structure. You can create nested directories and files using `/` as a separator (e.g., `my_dir/my_file.txt`).\n\nTo answer user queries, carefully analyze the query and decompose it into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use `look_in` to examine the current state of the file system, and `look_back` to review the history of commands if needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"documents,\" then create a file named \"report.txt\" inside it, and write \"Sales figures are up!\" into the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('documents', mode='dir')\nlay_path('documents/report.txt')\nwrite_over('documents/report.txt', 'Sales figures are up!')\nview('documents/report.txt') # Verify the content\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the current directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nsuper() # Necessary for mod_perms if permissions need to be changed\nlay_path('test_file.txt') # Create a file to make the output more interesting\nmod_perms('rwx------', 'test_file.txt') # Change permissions to demonstrate show_perm\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all `.log` files.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('error_log1.log')\nwrite_over('error_log1.log', 'First error log.\\nAnother error here.\\n')\nlay_path('error_log2.log', mode='file')\nwrite_over('error_log2.log', 'Second error log.\\nNo errors found.\\n')\nmatch_it('error', 'error_log*.log')\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. Key learnings:\n\n1. **`super()` is essential:**  Many operations, especially those involving file system modifications (like `destory` and `mod_perms`), require elevated privileges. Always call `super()` before attempting such operations. It appears to be a toggle, so you don't need to call it repeatedly.\n\n2. **Error Handling:** The environment provides limited error messages. Pay close attention to the output to understand if an operation failed and why.\n\n3. **State Persistence:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Files created, modified, or deleted will persist until explicitly changed or the environment is reset.\n\n4. **Pathing:**  The environment uses a standard file system pathing structure. You can create nested directories and files using `/` as a separator (e.g., `my_dir/my_file.txt`).\n\nTo answer user queries, carefully analyze the query and decompose it into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use `look_in` to examine the current state of the file system, and `look_back` to review the history of commands if needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"documents,\" then create a file named \"report.txt\" inside it, and write \"Sales figures are up!\" into the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('documents', mode='dir')\nlay_path('documents/report.txt')\nwrite_over('documents/report.txt', 'Sales figures are up!')\nview('documents/report.txt') # Verify the content\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the current directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nsuper() # Necessary for mod_perms if permissions need to be changed\nlay_path('test_file.txt') # Create a file to make the output more interesting\nmod_perms('rwx------', 'test_file.txt') # Change permissions to demonstrate show_perm\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all `.log` files.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('error_log1.log')\nwrite_over('error_log1.log', 'First error log.\\nAnother error here.\\n')\nlay_path('error_log2.log', mode='file')\nwrite_over('error_log2.log', 'Second error log.\\nNo errors found.\\n')\nmatch_it('error', 'error_log*.log')\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Always call `super()` before attempting such operations. It appears to be a toggle, so you don't need to call it repeatedly.\n\n2. **Error Handling:** The environment provides limited error messages. Pay close attention to the output to understand if an operation failed and why.\n\n3. **State Persistence:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Files created, modified, or deleted will persist until explicitly changed or the environment is reset.\n\n4. **Pathing:**  The environment uses a standard file system pathing structure. You can create nested directories and files using `/` as a separator (e.g., `my_dir/my_file.txt`).\n\nTo answer user queries, carefully analyze the query and decompose it into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use `look_in` to examine the current state of the file system, and `look_back` to review the history of commands if needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"documents,\" then create a file named \"report.txt\" inside it, and write \"Sales figures are up!\" into the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('documents', mode='dir')\nlay_path('documents/report.txt')\nwrite_over('documents/report.txt', 'Sales figures are up!')\nview('documents/report.txt') # Verify the content\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the current directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nsuper() # Necessary for mod_perms if permissions need to be changed\nlay_path('test_file.txt') # Create a file to make the output more interesting\nmod_perms('rwx------', 'test_file.txt') # Change permissions to demonstrate show_perm\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all `.log` files.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('error_log1.log')\nwrite_over('error_log1.log', 'First error log.\\nAnother error here.\\n')\nlay_path('error_log2.log', mode='file')\nwrite_over('error_log2.log', 'Second error log.\\nNo errors found.\\n')\nmatch_it('error', 'error_log*.log')\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. Key learnings:\n\n1. **`super()` is essential:**  Many operations, especially those involving file system modifications (like `destory` and `mod_perms`), require elevated privileges. Always call `super()` before attempting such operations. It appears to be a toggle, so you don't need to call it repeatedly.\n\n2. **Error Handling:** The environment provides limited error messages. Pay close attention to the output to understand if an operation failed and why.\n\n3. **State Persistence:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Files created, modified, or deleted will persist until explicitly changed or the environment is reset.\n\n4. **Pathing:**  The environment uses a standard file system pathing structure. You can create nested directories and files using `/` as a separator (e.g., `my_dir/my_file.txt`).\n\nTo answer user queries, carefully analyze the query and decompose it into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use `look_in` to examine the current state of the file system, and `look_back` to review the history of commands if needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"documents,\" then create a file named \"report.txt\" inside it, and write \"Sales figures are up!\" into the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('documents', mode='dir')\nlay_path('documents/report.txt')\nwrite_over('documents/report.txt', 'Sales figures are up!')\nview('documents/report.txt') # Verify the content\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the current directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nsuper() # Necessary for mod_perms if permissions need to be changed\nlay_path('test_file.txt') # Create a file to make the output more interesting\nmod_perms('rwx------', 'test_file.txt') # Change permissions to demonstrate show_perm\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all `.log` files.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('error_log1.log')\nwrite_over('error_log1.log', 'First error log.\\nAnother error here.\\n')\nlay_path('error_log2.log', mode='file')\nwrite_over('error_log2.log', 'Second error log.\\nNo errors found.\\n')\nmatch_it('error', 'error_log*.log')\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. Key learnings:\n\n1. **`super()` is essential:**  Many operations, especially those involving file system modifications (like `destory` and `mod_perms`), require elevated privileges. Always call `super()` before attempting such operations. It appears to be a toggle, so you don't need to call it repeatedly.\n\n2. **Error Handling:** The environment provides limited error messages. Pay close attention to the output to understand if an operation failed and why.\n\n3. **State Persistence:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Files created, modified, or deleted will persist until explicitly changed or the environment is reset.\n\n4. **Pathing:**  The environment uses a standard file system pathing structure. You can create nested directories and files using `/` as a separator (e.g., `my_dir/my_file.txt`).\n\nTo answer user queries, carefully analyze the query and decompose it into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use `look_in` to examine the current state of the file system, and `look_back` to review the history of commands if needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"documents,\" then create a file named \"report.txt\" inside it, and write \"Sales figures are up!\" into the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('documents', mode='dir')\nlay_path('documents/report.txt')\nwrite_over('documents/report.txt', 'Sales figures are up!')\nview('documents/report.txt') # Verify the content\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the current directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nsuper() # Necessary for mod_perms if permissions need to be changed\nlay_path('test_file.txt') # Create a file to make the output more interesting\nmod_perms('rwx------', 'test_file.txt') # Change permissions to demonstrate show_perm\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all `.log` files.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('error_log1.log')\nwrite_over('error_log1.log', 'First error log.\\nAnother error here.\\n')\nlay_path('error_log2.log', mode='file')\nwrite_over('error_log2.log', 'Second error log.\\nNo errors found.\\n')\nmatch_it('error', 'error_log*.log')\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

You can create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. Key learnings:\n\n1. **`super()` is essential:**  Many operations, especially those involving file system modifications (like `destory` and `mod_perms`), require elevated privileges. Always call `super()` before attempting such operations. It appears to be a toggle, so you don't need to call it repeatedly.\n\n2. **Error Handling:** The environment provides limited error messages. Pay close attention to the output to understand if an operation failed and why.\n\n3. **State Persistence:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Files created, modified, or deleted will persist until explicitly changed or the environment is reset.\n\n4. **Pathing:**  The environment uses a standard file system pathing structure. You can create nested directories and files using `/` as a separator (e.g., `my_dir/my_file.txt`).\n\nTo answer user queries, carefully analyze the query and decompose it into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use `look_in` to examine the current state of the file system, and `look_back` to review the history of commands if needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"documents,\" then create a file named \"report.txt\" inside it, and write \"Sales figures are up!\" into the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('documents', mode='dir')\nlay_path('documents/report.txt')\nwrite_over('documents/report.txt', 'Sales figures are up!')\nview('documents/report.txt') # Verify the content\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the current directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nsuper() # Necessary for mod_perms if permissions need to be changed\nlay_path('test_file.txt') # Create a file to make the output more interesting\nmod_perms('rwx------', 'test_file.txt') # Change permissions to demonstrate show_perm\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all `.log` files.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('error_log1.log')\nwrite_over('error_log1.log', 'First error log.\\nAnother error here.\\n')\nlay_path('error_log2.log', mode='file')\nwrite_over('error_log2.log', 'Second error log.\\nNo errors found.\\n')\nmatch_it('error', 'error_log*.log')\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

You can create, delete, modify, and view files and directories. Key learnings:\n\n1. **`super()` is essential:**  Many operations, especially those involving file system modifications (like `destory` and `mod_perms`), require elevated privileges. Always call `super()` before attempting such operations. It appears to be a toggle, so you don't need to call it repeatedly.\n\n2. **Error Handling:** The environment provides limited error messages. Pay close attention to the output to understand if an operation failed and why.\n\n3. **State Persistence:** The environment maintains state between function calls. Files created, modified, or deleted will persist until explicitly changed or the environment is reset.\n\n4. **Pathing:**  The environment uses a standard file system pathing structure. You can create nested directories and files using `/` as a separator (e.g., `my_dir/my_file.txt`).\n\nTo answer user queries, carefully analyze the query and decompose it into a sequence of function calls that achieve the desired outcome. Use `look_in` to examine the current state of the file system, and `look_back` to review the history of commands if needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example Query 1:** Create a directory named \"documents,\" then create a file named \"report.txt\" inside it, and write \"Sales figures are up!\" into the file.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('documents', mode='dir')\nlay_path('documents/report.txt')\nwrite_over('documents/report.txt', 'Sales figures are up!')\nview('documents/report.txt') # Verify the content\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 2:** List all files and directories in the current directory, including their permissions.\n\n<function_list>\nsuper() # Necessary for mod_perms if permissions need to be changed\nlay_path('test_file.txt') # Create a file to make the output more interesting\nmod_perms('rwx------', 'test_file.txt') # Change permissions to demonstrate show_perm\nlook_in(show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\n**Example Query 3:**  Find all occurrences of the word \"error\" in all `.log` files.\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path('error_log1.log')\nwrite_over('error_log1.log', 'First error log.\\nAnother error here.\\n')\nlay_path('error_log2.log', mode='file')\nwrite_over('error_log2.log', 'Second error log.\\nNo errors found.\\n')\nmatch_it('error', 'error_log*.log')\n</function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
