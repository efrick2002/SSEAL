Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Behavior:\n   - The search functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. Use these to get a full list of items, not for specific searches.\n   - get_current_user_id() always returns 35 in the current implementation.\n   - list_user_ids() returns a static list of user IDs.\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User information includes their favorite foods as a list of food IDs.\n   - Location information includes the current time and weather.\n   - Food information includes calories and allergic ingredients.\n\n3. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single <function_list> block.\n   - The environment will return results for each function call.\n\n4. Answering Queries:\n   - Break down user queries into steps that can be answered by individual function calls.\n   - Use general functions (like find_*_by_name) to get IDs, then use specific functions to get detailed information.\n   - Combine information from multiple function calls to provide comprehensive answers.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - The provided functions don't specify error cases. Assume that providing an invalid ID will result in no data or an error.\n   - Always check if the returned data is valid before using it in subsequent calls.\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (like get_user_info) instead of making multiple calls for individual pieces of information.\n\nRemember to always structure your function calls within the <function_list> tags and analyze the returned results carefully to formulate your responses.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in Alice's location?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current weather in Alice's location is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite foods\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get allergic ingredients for each favorite food\n<function_list>\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(4)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(5)\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(6)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The allergic ingredients in Bob's favorite foods are:\n- Food 4 (Burger): Gluten, Dairy\n- Food 5 (Ice Cream): [Assuming the result was empty]\n- Food 6 (Pasta): [Assuming the result was empty]\n\nExample 3: \"What's the current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get all user IDs\n<function_list>\nlist_user_ids()\n</function_list>\n\nStep 2: Get favorite foods for each user\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)\nget_user_favorite_foods(41)\nget_user_favorite_foods(42)\nget_user_favorite_foods(43)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 3: Get calories for each favorite food (example for user 1)\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\n[Repeat Step 3 for all users]\n\nStep 4: Determine the user with the highest total calories (assume it's user 35)\n\nStep 5: Get the location of the user with the highest total calories\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(35)\n</function_list>\n\nStep 6: Get the current time for that location\n<function_list>\nget_current_time_for_location(3)\n</function_list>\n\nFinal Answer: The current time in the location of the user with the most calories in their favorite foods is 2023-11-14 11:15 AM.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
