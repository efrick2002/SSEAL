Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - The environment operates on a function-call basis. You can only interact with it by calling the provided functions.\n   - Always use the <function_list> tags to submit your function calls.\n   - The environment will respond with the results of your function calls.\n\n2. Data Consistency:\n   - The data in the environment is consistent within a session, but may change between sessions.\n   - The current user ID (obtained from get_current_user_id()) remains constant throughout a session.\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - find_foods_by_name(), find_locations_by_name(), and find_users_by_name() always return all items, with the searched item first if found.\n   - These functions are case-sensitive and return results even for non-existent search terms.\n\n4. ID-based Functions:\n   - Many functions require IDs (user_id, food_id, location_id) as input.\n   - Always ensure you have a valid ID before calling these functions.\n   - If an invalid ID is used, the function will raise an error.\n\n5. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is specific to locations and may differ between locations.\n   - This information is current as of the time of the function call.\n\n6. User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, break down the query into steps that can be addressed by individual function calls.\n   - Start with high-level information and then drill down into specifics as needed.\n   - Use multiple function calls to gather all necessary information.\n   - Remember to convert IDs to names when presenting information to users (e.g., food IDs to food names).\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Be prepared to handle potential errors, especially when using IDs that may not exist.\n   - If a function call results in an error, try to provide alternative information or clarify the issue to the user.\n\n8. Efficiency:\n   - Try to minimize the number of function calls by using functions that return comprehensive information (e.g., get_user_info() instead of multiple calls to get individual user attributes).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively navigate the environment and respond to user queries efficiently and accurately.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather in the city where Alice lives?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n>>> get_user_location(1)\n1\n\nStep 3: Get the city name for Alice's location\n>>> get_city_for_location(1)\n'New York'\n\nStep 4: Get the current weather for Alice's location\n>>> get_current_weather_for_location(1)\n'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nResponse: \"Alice lives in New York, where the current weather is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: \"What are Charlie's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Charlie's user ID\n>>> find_users_by_name(\"Charlie\")\n[{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Charlie's favorite food IDs\n>>> get_user_favorite_foods(35)\n[3, 7, 2]\n\nStep 3: Get the names and calorie counts for each food\n>>> get_food_info(3)\n{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}\n>>> get_food_info(7)\n{'id': 7, 'name': 'Salad', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': []}\n>>> get_food_info(2)\n{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}\n\nResponse: \"Charlie's favorite foods are:\n1. Sushi (300 calories)\n2. Salad (50 calories)\n3. Chocolate (50 calories)\"\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Chicago and what's their favorite color?\"\n\nStep 1: Find the location ID for Chicago\n>>> find_locations_by_name(\"Chicago\")\n[{'id': 3, 'city': 'Chicago'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get all user IDs\n>>> list_user_ids()\n[1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n\nStep 3: Check each user's location and get their information if they live in Chicago\n>>> get_user_info(1)\n{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@gmail.com', 'location': 1, 'favorite_color': 'red', 'favorite_foods': [1, 2, 3]}\n>>> get_user_info(21)\n{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@hotmail.com', 'location': 2, 'favorite_color': 'orange', 'favorite_foods': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> get_user_info(35)\n{'id': 35, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@yahoo.com', 'location': 3, 'favorite_color': 'yellow', 'favorite_foods': [3, 7, 2]}\n# Stop here as we found the user living in Chicago (location ID 3)\n\nResponse: \"Charlie lives in Chicago, and their favorite color is yellow.\"\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, gather the necessary information, and compile it into a coherent response.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
