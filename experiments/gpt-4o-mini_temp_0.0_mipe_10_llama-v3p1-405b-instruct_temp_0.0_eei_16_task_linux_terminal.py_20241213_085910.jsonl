Be careful when using functions that modify files or directories, as they can have unintended consequences.\n\nWhen using the `destory` function, make sure to specify the correct path and recursive and force flags to avoid accidentally removing important files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `lay_path` function, make sure to specify the correct mode to avoid creating a file or directory with incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `look_in` function, make sure to specify the correct path and flags to avoid listing incorrect files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `match_it` function, make sure to specify the correct pattern and files to avoid searching for incorrect patterns.\n\nWhen using the `mod_perms` function, make sure to specify the correct permission string and path to avoid setting incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `move_it` function, make sure to specify the correct source and destination paths to avoid moving files or directories to incorrect locations.\n\nWhen using the `view` function, make sure to specify the correct files to avoid displaying incorrect contents.\n\nWhen using the `write_next` and `write_over` functions, make sure to specify the correct filename and content to avoid writing to incorrect files.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of these functions to gather information and perform actions. For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be careful when using functions that modify files or directories, as they can have unintended consequences.\n\nWhen using the `destory` function, make sure to specify the correct path and recursive and force flags to avoid accidentally removing important files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `lay_path` function, make sure to specify the correct mode to avoid creating a file or directory with incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `look_in` function, make sure to specify the correct path and flags to avoid listing incorrect files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `match_it` function, make sure to specify the correct pattern and files to avoid searching for incorrect patterns.\n\nWhen using the `mod_perms` function, make sure to specify the correct permission string and path to avoid setting incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `move_it` function, make sure to specify the correct source and destination paths to avoid moving files or directories to incorrect locations.\n\nWhen using the `view` function, make sure to specify the correct files to avoid displaying incorrect contents.\n\nWhen using the `write_next` and `write_over` functions, make sure to specify the correct filename and content to avoid writing to incorrect files.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of these functions to gather information and perform actions. For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Be careful when using functions that modify files or directories, as they can have unintended consequences.\n\nWhen using the `destory` function, make sure to specify the correct path and recursive and force flags to avoid accidentally removing important files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `lay_path` function, make sure to specify the correct mode to avoid creating a file or directory with incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `look_in` function, make sure to specify the correct path and flags to avoid listing incorrect files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `match_it` function, make sure to specify the correct pattern and files to avoid searching for incorrect patterns.\n\nWhen using the `mod_perms` function, make sure to specify the correct permission string and path to avoid setting incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `move_it` function, make sure to specify the correct source and destination paths to avoid moving files or directories to incorrect locations.\n\nWhen using the `view` function, make sure to specify the correct files to avoid displaying incorrect contents.\n\nWhen using the `write_next` and `write_over` functions, make sure to specify the correct filename and content to avoid writing to incorrect files.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of these functions to gather information and perform actions. For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be careful when using functions that modify files or directories, as they can have unintended consequences.\n\nWhen using the `destory` function, make sure to specify the correct path and recursive and force flags to avoid accidentally removing important files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `lay_path` function, make sure to specify the correct mode to avoid creating a file or directory with incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `look_in` function, make sure to specify the correct path and flags to avoid listing incorrect files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `match_it` function, make sure to specify the correct pattern and files to avoid searching for incorrect patterns.\n\nWhen using the `mod_perms` function, make sure to specify the correct permission string and path to avoid setting incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `move_it` function, make sure to specify the correct source and destination paths to avoid moving files or directories to incorrect locations.\n\nWhen using the `view` function, make sure to specify the correct files to avoid displaying incorrect contents.\n\nWhen using the `write_next` and `write_over` functions, make sure to specify the correct filename and content to avoid writing to incorrect files.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of these functions to gather information and perform actions. For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be careful when using functions that modify files or directories, as they can have unintended consequences.\n\nWhen using the `destory` function, make sure to specify the correct path and recursive and force flags to avoid accidentally removing important files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `lay_path` function, make sure to specify the correct mode to avoid creating a file or directory with incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `look_in` function, make sure to specify the correct path and flags to avoid listing incorrect files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `match_it` function, make sure to specify the correct pattern and files to avoid searching for incorrect patterns.\n\nWhen using the `mod_perms` function, make sure to specify the correct permission string and path to avoid setting incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `move_it` function, make sure to specify the correct source and destination paths to avoid moving files or directories to incorrect locations.\n\nWhen using the `view` function, make sure to specify the correct files to avoid displaying incorrect contents.\n\nWhen using the `write_next` and `write_over` functions, make sure to specify the correct filename and content to avoid writing to incorrect files.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of these functions to gather information and perform actions. For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be careful when using functions that modify files or directories, as they can have unintended consequences.\n\nWhen using the `destory` function, make sure to specify the correct path and recursive and force flags to avoid accidentally removing important files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `lay_path` function, make sure to specify the correct mode to avoid creating a file or directory with incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `look_in` function, make sure to specify the correct path and flags to avoid listing incorrect files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `match_it` function, make sure to specify the correct pattern and files to avoid searching for incorrect patterns.\n\nWhen using the `mod_perms` function, make sure to specify the correct permission string and path to avoid setting incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `move_it` function, make sure to specify the correct source and destination paths to avoid moving files or directories to incorrect locations.\n\nWhen using the `view` function, make sure to specify the correct files to avoid displaying incorrect contents.\n\nWhen using the `write_next` and `write_over` functions, make sure to specify the correct filename and content to avoid writing to incorrect files.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of these functions to gather information and perform actions. For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be careful when using functions that modify files or directories, as they can have unintended consequences.\n\nWhen using the `destory` function, make sure to specify the correct path and recursive and force flags to avoid accidentally removing important files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `lay_path` function, make sure to specify the correct mode to avoid creating a file or directory with incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `look_in` function, make sure to specify the correct path and flags to avoid listing incorrect files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `match_it` function, make sure to specify the correct pattern and files to avoid searching for incorrect patterns.\n\nWhen using the `mod_perms` function, make sure to specify the correct permission string and path to avoid setting incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `move_it` function, make sure to specify the correct source and destination paths to avoid moving files or directories to incorrect locations.\n\nWhen using the `view` function, make sure to specify the correct files to avoid displaying incorrect contents.\n\nWhen using the `write_next` and `write_over` functions, make sure to specify the correct filename and content to avoid writing to incorrect files.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of these functions to gather information and perform actions. For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
