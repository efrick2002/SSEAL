additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs. Be prepared to handle these cases gracefully in your queries.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not behave as expected, try different inputs based on the function's documentation. For example, if a user ID cannot be resolved, test with other IDs.\n\n4. **Use of Lists**: Some functions accept lists as input. Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs. Be prepared to handle these cases gracefully in your queries.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not behave as expected, try different inputs based on the function's documentation. For example, if a user ID cannot be resolved, test with other IDs.\n\n4. **Use of Lists**: Some functions accept lists as input. Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs. Be prepared to handle these cases gracefully in your queries.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not behave as expected, try different inputs based on the function's documentation. For example, if a user ID cannot be resolved, test with other IDs.\n\n4. **Use of Lists**: Some functions accept lists as input. Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs. Be prepared to handle these cases gracefully in your queries.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not behave as expected, try different inputs based on the function's documentation. For example, if a user ID cannot be resolved, test with other IDs.\n\n4. **Use of Lists**: Some functions accept lists as input. Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs. Be prepared to handle these cases gracefully in your queries.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not behave as expected, try different inputs based on the function's documentation. For example, if a user ID cannot be resolved, test with other IDs.\n\n4. **Use of Lists**: Some functions accept lists as input. Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs. Be prepared to handle these cases gracefully in your queries.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not behave as expected, try different inputs based on the function's documentation. For example, if a user ID cannot be resolved, test with other IDs.\n\n4. **Use of Lists**: Some functions accept lists as input. Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs.

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs. Be prepared to handle these cases gracefully in your queries.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not behave as expected, try different inputs based on the function's documentation. For example, if a user ID cannot be resolved, test with other IDs.\n\n4. **Use of Lists**: Some functions accept lists as input. Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs. Be prepared to handle these cases gracefully in your queries.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not behave as expected, try different inputs based on the function's documentation. For example, if a user ID cannot be resolved, test with other IDs.\n\n4. **Use of Lists**: Some functions accept lists as input. Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the argument types and return types to avoid errors. For instance, functions that resolve user IDs will return error messages if the ID is invalid.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return error messages when provided with invalid inputs. Be prepared to handle these cases gracefully in your queries.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not behave as expected, try different inputs based on the function's documentation. For example, if a user ID cannot be resolved, test with other IDs.\n\n4. **Use of Lists**: Some functions accept lists as input. Ensure you provide the correct format (e.g., a list of integers) to avoid errors.\n\n5. **Consistent Outputs**: Functions like `i()` and `k()` return consistent outputs. Use these functions to establish baseline values in your queries.\n\n6. **Documentation Reference**: Always refer to the updated function documentation for guidance on how to use each function effectively.\n\n7. **Exploration**: If you encounter unexpected results, consider exploring related functions to gather more context or data.\n\n8. **Function Calls**: When constructing your function calls, ensure that you follow the expected input types and formats as outlined in the documentation.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What is the weather in Los Angeles?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `g(2)` to retrieve weather information for Los Angeles.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 2, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'current_time': '2023-11-14 7:45 AM', 'current_weather': 'Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F'}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What are the allergens in Pizza?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `h(1)` to get information about Pizza.\n   - **Expected Output**: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 2**: Extract the allergens from the output.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What is Alice's favorite color?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `n(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite color.\n   - **Expected Output**: `'red'`\n\n4. **User Query**: \"List all food items.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `c([])` to retrieve all food items.\n   - **Expected Output**: `[{ 'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate' }, ...]`\n\n5. **User Query**: \"What are the calories in Chocolate?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `y(2)` to get the calorie count for Chocolate.\n   - **Expected Output**: `50`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
