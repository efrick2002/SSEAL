</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is important to understand the behavior of the functions, especially those that do not strictly filter results based on input parameters. Functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name` return a broad list of results, which may include items not directly matching the input query. This behavior should be considered when interpreting results.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that list or search for items (e.g., `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, `find_users_by_name`) to gather IDs. These IDs can then be used with more specific functions (e.g., `get_food_info`, `get_location_info`, `get_user_info`) to retrieve detailed information.\n\nIf a function raises an exception, it is likely due to an invalid ID. Use the search functions to verify available IDs before making calls that require them.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to first explore the environment using broad queries to understand the available data and then narrow down to specific queries as needed.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Find detailed information about a specific food item.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are the details of the food item 'Pizza'?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the list of foods and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_food_info(1)` to get detailed information about \"Pizza\".\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")\n   get_food_info(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 2: Get the current weather in 'New York'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the list of locations and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather in New York.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")\n   get_weather_at_location(1)\n   </function_list>\n\n**Example 3: Retrieve the favorite foods of a user named 'Alice'.**\n\n1. **User Query:** \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\n2. **Process:**\n   - Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the list of users and their IDs.\n   - Use the ID from the result to call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get Alice's favorite foods.\n   - Use the food IDs to call `get_food_name` for each to get their names.\n3. **Function Calls:**\n   <function_list>\n   find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n   get_user_favorite_foods(1)\n   get_food_name(1)\n   get_food_name(2)\n   get_food_name(3)\n   </function_list>\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
