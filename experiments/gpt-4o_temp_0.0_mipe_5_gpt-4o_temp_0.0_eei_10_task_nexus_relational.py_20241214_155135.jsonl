Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Some functions, like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`, do not filter by the provided name and instead return all available entries. This is crucial to know when attempting to retrieve specific data.\n\nTo effectively use the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the information you need.\n2. Use functions that directly retrieve specific data, such as `get_user_info` or `get_food_info`, when you have an ID.\n3. Use list functions like `list_user_ids` to gather IDs if needed.\n4. Be aware that some functions may not behave as their names suggest, particularly those that imply filtering by name.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow a systematic approach:\n- Determine the type of information required.\n- Identify the relevant function(s) to call.\n- Use the function outputs to construct a comprehensive response.\n\nRemember, the environment only allows function calls within the `<function_list>` tags, and you will receive feedback in the form of function outputs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What are the favorite foods of the user named Alice?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get the user ID for Alice.\n- Step 2: Use `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` with the retrieved user ID to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n- Step 3: For each food ID, use `get_food_name(food_id)` to get the name of the food.\n\nExample Query 2: \"What is the current weather in Los Angeles?\"\n- Step 1: Use `find_locations_by_name(\"Los Angeles\")` to get the location ID for Los Angeles.\n- Step 2: Use `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` with the retrieved location ID to get the current weather.\n\nExample Query 3: \"What is the email of the user with ID 21?\"\n- Step 1: Use `get_user_email(21)` to directly retrieve the email address.\n\nThese examples illustrate how to navigate the environment to answer specific queries by leveraging the available functions effectively.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
