Common Pitfalls:\n- Cannot reference variables across operations\n- Must use correct column names after aggregations\n- Need exact table names with extensions\n- Careful with column name conflicts in merges\n\n6. Error Handling:\n- Check table existence before operations\n- Verify column names exist before calculations\n- Consider null/zero values in divisions\n- Validate join columns exist before merges\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find the most efficient scorers (points per minute) who shoot above 50%\"\n```python\nexecute_operations([\n    {\"function\": \"read_db\", \"args\": {\"name\": \"player_states.tbl\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"calculate_column\", \"args\": {\n        \"new_column\": \"scoring_efficiency\",\n        \"expression\": \"points_per_game / minutes_per_game\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"select\", \"args\": {\n        \"conditions\": {\"field_goal_percentage\": (\">\", 0.5)}\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"sort\", \"args\": {\n        \"columns\": \"scoring_efficiency\",\n        \"ascending\": False\n    }}\n])\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Compare team payroll to performance\"\n```python\nexecute_operations([\n    {\"function\": \"read_db\", \"args\": {\"name\": \"teams.tbl\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"merge_tables\", \"args\": {\n        \"df2\": read_db(\"team_stats.tbl\"),\n        \"on\": \"team_id\",\n        \"how\": \"inner\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"calculate_column\", \"args\": {\n        \"new_column\": \"cost_per_win\",\n        \"expression\": \"annual_budget / wins\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"sort\", \"args\": {\n        \"columns\": \"cost_per_win\",\n        \"ascending\": True\n    }}\n])\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find average statistics by position for players earning above $40M\"\n```python\nexecute_operations([\n    {\"function\": \"read_db\", \"args\": {\"name\": \"player.tbl\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"merge_tables\", \"args\": {\n        \"df2\": read_db(\"player_states.tbl\"),\n        \"on\": \"player_id\",\n        \"how\": \"inner\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"select\", \"args\": {\n        \"conditions\": {\"salary\": (\">\", 40000000)}\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"aggregate\", \"args\": {\n        \"group_by\": \"position\",\n        \"agg_dict\": {\n            \"points_per_game\": \"mean\",\n            \"rebounds_per_game\": \"mean\",\n            \"assists_per_game\": \"mean\"\n        }\n    }}\n])\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Data Flow:\n- Always start with read_db() to get initial DataFrame\n- Use execute_operations() for multi-step operations\n- Results flow sequentially between operations\n- Cannot store intermediate results in variables\n\n2. Table Structure:\n- Always include .tbl extension when reading tables\n- Use ls() and get_metadata() first to understand schema\n- Key relationships: team_id links most tables\n- player_id links player and player_states tables\n\n3. Column Naming:\n- After aggregation with multiple operations, columns become column_operation\n- In calculations, reference original column names directly\n- Merged tables maintain original column names\n- Calculate_column creates new columns with given names\n\n4. Best Practices:\n- Build complex operations incrementally\n- Verify intermediate results when debugging\n- Use select() to check column names after operations\n- Start with simpler operations before combining\n\n5. Common Pitfalls:\n- Cannot reference variables across operations\n- Must use correct column names after aggregations\n- Need exact table names with extensions\n- Careful with column name conflicts in merges\n\n6. Error Handling:\n- Check table existence before operations\n- Verify column names exist before calculations\n- Consider null/zero values in divisions\n- Validate join columns exist before merges\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find the most efficient scorers (points per minute) who shoot above 50%\"\n```python\nexecute_operations([\n    {\"function\": \"read_db\", \"args\": {\"name\": \"player_states.tbl\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"calculate_column\", \"args\": {\n        \"new_column\": \"scoring_efficiency\",\n        \"expression\": \"points_per_game / minutes_per_game\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"select\", \"args\": {\n        \"conditions\": {\"field_goal_percentage\": (\">\", 0.5)}\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"sort\", \"args\": {\n        \"columns\": \"scoring_efficiency\",\n        \"ascending\": False\n    }}\n])\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Compare team payroll to performance\"\n```python\nexecute_operations([\n    {\"function\": \"read_db\", \"args\": {\"name\": \"teams.tbl\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"merge_tables\", \"args\": {\n        \"df2\": read_db(\"team_stats.tbl\"),\n        \"on\": \"team_id\",\n        \"how\": \"inner\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"calculate_column\", \"args\": {\n        \"new_column\": \"cost_per_win\",\n        \"expression\": \"annual_budget / wins\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"sort\", \"args\": {\n        \"columns\": \"cost_per_win\",\n        \"ascending\": True\n    }}\n])\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find average statistics by position for players earning above $40M\"\n```python\nexecute_operations([\n    {\"function\": \"read_db\", \"args\": {\"name\": \"player.tbl\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"merge_tables\", \"args\": {\n        \"df2\": read_db(\"player_states.tbl\"),\n        \"on\": \"player_id\",\n        \"how\": \"inner\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"select\", \"args\": {\n        \"conditions\": {\"salary\": (\">\", 40000000)}\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"aggregate\", \"args\": {\n        \"group_by\": \"position\",\n        \"agg_dict\": {\n            \"points_per_game\": \"mean\",\n            \"rebounds_per_game\": \"mean\",\n            \"assists_per_game\": \"mean\"\n        }\n    }}\n])\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Column Naming:\n- After aggregation with multiple operations, columns become column_operation\n- In calculations, reference original column names directly\n- Merged tables maintain original column names\n- Calculate_column creates new columns with given names\n\n4.

Column Naming:\n- After aggregation with multiple operations, columns become column_operation\n- In calculations, reference original column names directly\n- Merged tables maintain original column names\n- Calculate_column creates new columns with given names\n\n4.

Column Naming:\n- After aggregation with multiple operations, columns become column_operation\n- In calculations, reference original column names directly\n- Merged tables maintain original column names\n- Calculate_column creates new columns with given names\n\n4. Best Practices:\n- Build complex operations incrementally\n- Verify intermediate results when debugging\n- Use select() to check column names after operations\n- Start with simpler operations before combining\n\n5. Common Pitfalls:\n- Cannot reference variables across operations\n- Must use correct column names after aggregations\n- Need exact table names with extensions\n- Careful with column name conflicts in merges\n\n6. Error Handling:\n- Check table existence before operations\n- Verify column names exist before calculations\n- Consider null/zero values in divisions\n- Validate join columns exist before merges\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find the most efficient scorers (points per minute) who shoot above 50%\"\n```python\nexecute_operations([\n    {\"function\": \"read_db\", \"args\": {\"name\": \"player_states.tbl\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"calculate_column\", \"args\": {\n        \"new_column\": \"scoring_efficiency\",\n        \"expression\": \"points_per_game / minutes_per_game\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"select\", \"args\": {\n        \"conditions\": {\"field_goal_percentage\": (\">\", 0.5)}\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"sort\", \"args\": {\n        \"columns\": \"scoring_efficiency\",\n        \"ascending\": False\n    }}\n])\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Compare team payroll to performance\"\n```python\nexecute_operations([\n    {\"function\": \"read_db\", \"args\": {\"name\": \"teams.tbl\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"merge_tables\", \"args\": {\n        \"df2\": read_db(\"team_stats.tbl\"),\n        \"on\": \"team_id\",\n        \"how\": \"inner\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"calculate_column\", \"args\": {\n        \"new_column\": \"cost_per_win\",\n        \"expression\": \"annual_budget / wins\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"sort\", \"args\": {\n        \"columns\": \"cost_per_win\",\n        \"ascending\": True\n    }}\n])\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Find average statistics by position for players earning above $40M\"\n```python\nexecute_operations([\n    {\"function\": \"read_db\", \"args\": {\"name\": \"player.tbl\"}},\n    {\"function\": \"merge_tables\", \"args\": {\n        \"df2\": read_db(\"player_states.tbl\"),\n        \"on\": \"player_id\",\n        \"how\": \"inner\"\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"select\", \"args\": {\n        \"conditions\": {\"salary\": (\">\", 40000000)}\n    }},\n    {\"function\": \"aggregate\", \"args\": {\n        \"group_by\": \"position\",\n        \"agg_dict\": {\n            \"points_per_game\": \"mean\",\n            \"rebounds_per_game\": \"mean\",\n            \"assists_per_game\": \"mean\"\n        }\n    }}\n])\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
