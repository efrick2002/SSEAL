Data Structure:\n- Users: IDs [1,21,35,41,42,43]\n- Locations: IDs [1-5]\n- Foods: IDs [1-7]\n\n2. Function Categories:\n- Listing functions (x,z,c): Return full datasets, accept iterables for ordering\n- Detail functions (f,g,h): Return detailed information about specific entities\n- Property functions (t,n,v,w): Return single properties of entities\n- Weather/time functions (e,q,r): Return location-specific information\n\n3. Best Practices:\n- Always validate IDs before use\n- Use listing functions (x,z,c) to get valid IDs\n- Chain functions for complex queries\n- Handle exceptions for invalid IDs\n\n4. Common Patterns:\n- Functions accepting IDs throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n- Listing functions accept any iterable and never throw exceptions\n- Many functions serve as convenient aliases for properties available in detail functions\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all users who like Pizza\"\n```python\n# 1.

Check each food's allergens\ndairy_foods = [food for food in foods if 'Dairy' in u(food['id'])]\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Structure:\n- Users: IDs [1,21,35,41,42,43]\n- Locations: IDs [1-5]\n- Foods: IDs [1-7]\n\n2. Function Categories:\n- Listing functions (x,z,c): Return full datasets, accept iterables for ordering\n- Detail functions (f,g,h): Return detailed information about specific entities\n- Property functions (t,n,v,w): Return single properties of entities\n- Weather/time functions (e,q,r): Return location-specific information\n\n3. Best Practices:\n- Always validate IDs before use\n- Use listing functions (x,z,c) to get valid IDs\n- Chain functions for complex queries\n- Handle exceptions for invalid IDs\n\n4. Common Patterns:\n- Functions accepting IDs throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n- Listing functions accept any iterable and never throw exceptions\n- Many functions serve as convenient aliases for properties available in detail functions\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all users who like Pizza\"\n```python\n# 1. Get Pizza's food ID\nfood_list = c([])  # Get full food list\npizza_id = next(food['id'] for food in food_list if food['name'] == 'Pizza')\n# 2. Get all users\nusers = z([])\n# 3. Check each user's favorites\npizza_lovers = [f(user['id']) for user in users if pizza_id in m(user['id'])]\n\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Charlie lives?\"\n```python\n# 1. Get Charlie's details\nusers = z([])\ncharlie_id = next(user['id'] for user in users if user['name'] == 'Charlie')\ncharlie_details = f(charlie_id)\n# 2. Get weather for Charlie's location\nweather = q(charlie_details['location'])\n```\n\nExample 3: \"List all foods with dairy allergies\"\n```python\n# 1. Get all foods\nfoods = c([])\n# 2. Check each food's allergens\ndairy_foods = [food for food in foods if 'Dairy' in u(food['id'])]\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Structure:\n- Users: IDs [1,21,35,41,42,43]\n- Locations: IDs [1-5]\n- Foods: IDs [1-7]\n\n2. Function Categories:\n- Listing functions (x,z,c): Return full datasets, accept iterables for ordering\n- Detail functions (f,g,h): Return detailed information about specific entities\n- Property functions (t,n,v,w): Return single properties of entities\n- Weather/time functions (e,q,r): Return location-specific information\n\n3. Best Practices:\n- Always validate IDs before use\n- Use listing functions (x,z,c) to get valid IDs\n- Chain functions for complex queries\n- Handle exceptions for invalid IDs\n\n4. Common Patterns:\n- Functions accepting IDs throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n- Listing functions accept any iterable and never throw exceptions\n- Many functions serve as convenient aliases for properties available in detail functions\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all users who like Pizza\"\n```python\n# 1.
