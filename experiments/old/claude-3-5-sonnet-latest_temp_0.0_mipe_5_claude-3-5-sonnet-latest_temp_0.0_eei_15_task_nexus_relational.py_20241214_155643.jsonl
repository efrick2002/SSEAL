Static Data:\n- Times and weather remain constant\n- User preferences and relationships are fixed\n- Food properties (calories, allergens) are constant\n\n4. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs return \"cannot be resolved\" exceptions\n- Search with invalid inputs returns full lists\n- No null/empty returns observed\n\nBest Practices:\n1. Start with get_current_user_id() for user-centric queries\n2. Use search functions for exploration, specific getters for details\n3.

Verify ID validity before chaining multiple calls\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find users who like spicy food\"\n```python\n# Since there's no direct spiciness indicator, we need to check all users' preferences\nall_users = find_users_by_name(\"\")  # Get complete user list\nfor user in all_users:\n    foods = get_user_favorite_foods(user['id'])\n    # Print user and their food preferences for manual analysis\n    print(f\"User {get_user_name(user['id'])}: {[get_food_name(f) for f in foods]}\")\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the most popular food among users in warm cities?\"\n```python\n# 1.

Search Functions:\n- Always return complete lists, ordered by relevance\n- Case-insensitive\n- Multiple word searches treat each word independently\n- Can search across multiple fields (e.g., names, attributes, properties)\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n- Users (6): Alice, Bob, Charlie, Donna, Eve, Frank\n- Locations (5): NY, LA, Chicago, Houston, Miami\n- Foods (7): Pizza, Chocolate, Sushi, Burger, Ice Cream, Pasta, Salad\n- Each user has one location (except Miami has two users)\n- Each user has 1-3 favorite foods\n\n3. Static Data:\n- Times and weather remain constant\n- User preferences and relationships are fixed\n- Food properties (calories, allergens) are constant\n\n4. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs return \"cannot be resolved\" exceptions\n- Search with invalid inputs returns full lists\n- No null/empty returns observed\n\nBest Practices:\n1. Start with get_current_user_id() for user-centric queries\n2. Use search functions for exploration, specific getters for details\n3. Chain functions to build complete information (e.g., location -> weather -> time)\n4. Verify ID validity before chaining multiple calls\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find users who like spicy food\"\n```python\n# Since there's no direct spiciness indicator, we need to check all users' preferences\nall_users = find_users_by_name(\"\")  # Get complete user list\nfor user in all_users:\n    foods = get_user_favorite_foods(user['id'])\n    # Print user and their food preferences for manual analysis\n    print(f\"User {get_user_name(user['id'])}: {[get_food_name(f) for f in foods]}\")\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the most popular food among users in warm cities?\"\n```python\n# 1.
