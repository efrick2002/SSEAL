ID Management:\n- All IDs must be positive integers\n- Users: IDs 1,21,35,41,42,43 only\n- Locations: IDs 1-5 consecutive\n- Foods: IDs 1-7 consecutive\n- String representations of numbers are invalid\n\n2. Search Behavior:\n- All search functions return complete lists\n- Case-insensitive matching\n- Empty string returns default ordered list\n- Special characters/Unicode accepted\n- Order varies based on fuzzy matching\n\n3. Data Relationships:\n- Each user has exactly one location\n- Users have 1-3 favorite foods\n- Miami (location 5) is only city with multiple users\n- Current user is always ID 35 (Charlie)\n\n4. Time/Weather:\n- Times maintain consistent timezone offsets\n- Weather/time stable across multiple calls\n- Each location has unique weather pattern\n\nOperating Guidelines:\n1. Always validate IDs before use\n2. Use empty string searches to get complete lists\n3. Don't try to store results in variables\n4. Chain function calls directly\n5. Handle exceptions for invalid IDs\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What foods does the user in Chicago like?\"\n\nSteps:\n1. Find user in Chicago:\n```python\nget_user_location(35)  # Charlie is in location 3 (Chicago)\nget_user_favorite_foods(35)  # Returns [3, 7, 2]\nget_food_name(3)  # \"Sushi\"\nget_food_name(7)  # \"Salad\"\nget_food_name(2)  # \"Chocolate\"\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Bob lives?\"\n\nSteps:\n1. Get Bob's location:\n```python\nget_user_location(21)  # Returns 2 (Los Angeles)\nget_current_weather_for_location(2)  # \"Sunny, Temperature: 75\u00b0F\"\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Which users are allergic to dairy?\"\n\nSteps:\n1. Get all foods with dairy:\n```python\nfind_foods_by_name(\"\")  # Get all foods\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(1)  # Pizza: [\"Gluten\", \"Dairy\"]\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(2)  # Chocolate: [\"Milk\", \"Soy\"]\n# Continue for all foods\n```\n2. Then check each user's favorite foods against dairy-containing foods\n```python\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)  # Check each user's preferences\n# Continue analysis\n```\n\nThis pattern of breaking down queries into specific function calls and chaining results is key to operating in this environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.
