Data Relationships:\n- Foods (IDs 1-7): Each has name, calories, allergic ingredients\n- Locations (IDs 1-5): Each has city name, time zone, weather\n- Users (IDs 1,21,35,41,42,43): Each has name, email, location, preferences\n\n2. Function Behavior Patterns:\n- Search functions always return complete lists\n- Case-insensitive searching\n- Consistent error handling with \"cannot be resolved\" exceptions\n- No variable assignments allowed - must use literal values\n\n3. Operating Guidelines:\n- Always validate IDs before using them\n- Use search functions to discover valid IDs\n- Cross-reference IDs between systems (e.g., user location ID \u2192 location info)\n- Handle errors for invalid IDs (0, 999, etc.)\n\n4. Time/Location Awareness:\n- Each location has its own timezone\n- Weather and time are location-specific\n- Multiple users can share same location\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather where Charlie lives?\"\n```python\n# 1. Get Charlie's user info (known ID 35)\nget_user_info(35)  # Shows location_id: 3\n# 2. Get weather for that location\nget_current_weather_for_location(3)  # \"Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\"\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What foods is Alice allergic to?\"\n```python\n# 1. Get Alice's favorite foods\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)  # Returns [1, 2, 3]\n# 2. Get allergies for each food\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(1)  # Pizza: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(2)  # Chocolate: ['Dairy']\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(3)  # Sushi: ['Fish']\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Who lives in Miami?\"\n```python\n# 1. Find Miami's location ID\nfind_locations_by_name(\"Miami\")  # ID: 5\n# 2. Check each user's location\nget_user_info(42)  # Eve - location: 5\nget_user_info(43)  # Frank - location: 5\n# Result: Eve and Frank live in Miami\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
