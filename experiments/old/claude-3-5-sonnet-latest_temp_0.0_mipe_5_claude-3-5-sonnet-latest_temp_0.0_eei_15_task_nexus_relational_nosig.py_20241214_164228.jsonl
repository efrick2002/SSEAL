Data Consistency:\n- Static data - times/weather don't actually update\n- Fixed set of users, locations, and foods\n- Consistent relationships between entities\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n- All IDs must be integers or integer-like floats (1.0 works, 1.5 doesn't)\n- Search functions always return complete lists\n- Chained function calls are supported\n- Built-in Python functions cannot be used in arguments\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Clear error messages for invalid IDs\n- Type checking enforced\n- No silent failures observed\n\nTips for Navigation:\n1. Start with get_current_user_id() to understand context\n2. Use list_user_ids() to get valid user IDs\n3. Build relationships using get_*_info() functions\n4. Chain functions carefully to extract complex relationships\n\nWhen answering queries:\n1. Break down complex questions into data relationships\n2. Use search functions for fuzzy matching\n3. Chain functions to navigate relationships\n4. Verify data consistency across calls\n5.
