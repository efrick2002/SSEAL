Function Call Format:\n   - Only direct function calls are allowed\n   - No variable assignments or complex expressions\n   - Each call must be on a single line\n\n2. Data Structure:\n   - Users: 6 users (IDs: 1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43)\n   - Locations: 5 cities (IDs: 1-5)\n   - Foods: 7 items (IDs: 1-7)\n   - Current user is always Charlie (ID: 35)\n\n3. Search Functions:\n   - All search functions return complete lists regardless of input\n   - Use empty string as search parameter for clearest intention\n   - Results are consistently ordered when using empty string\n\n4. Error Handling:\n   - Use direct ID values rather than variables\n   - IDs are always integers\n   - Invalid IDs will likely cause errors (stick to known IDs)\n\nOperating Guidelines:\n1. Start with empty-string searches to get full data sets\n2. Use get_current_user_id() to confirm system context\n3. Chain function calls to build complete information\n4. Document ID mappings for reference\n5. Prefer direct ID usage over search functions when ID is known\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the weather like where Charlie lives?\"\n```python\n# Step 1: Get Charlie's location\nget_user_location(35)  # Returns 3 (Chicago)\n# Step 2: Get weather for that location\nget_current_weather_for_location(3)  # Returns weather for Chicago\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What foods does Alice like that might contain allergens?\"\n```python\n# Step 1: Get Alice's favorite foods\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)  # Returns [1, 2, 3]\n# Step 2: Check allergens for each food\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(1)  # Pizza allergens\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(2)  # Chocolate allergens\nget_food_allergic_ingredients(3)  # Sushi allergens\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Who else lives in the same city as Eve?\"\n```python\n# Step 1: Get Eve's location\nget_user_location(42)  # Returns 5 (Miami)\n# Step 2: Get all users\nfind_users_by_name(\"\")  # Get all users\n# Step 3: Check each user's location to find matches with location 5\nget_user_location(1)  # Check Alice\nget_user_location(21)  # Check Bob\n# etc...\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.
