Filesystem State:\n   - The environment has a volatile filesystem\n   - Files and directories can appear/disappear between operations\n   - Always verify existence before manipulation\n\n2. Function Calling Strategy:\n   - Use look_in() to check current filesystem state\n   - Prepare directories before file operations\n   - Handle potential exceptions\n   - Chain operations carefully\n\n3. Key Constraints:\n   - Extremely strict mode validation for lay_path()\n   - Precise string handling for callback()\n   - Context-sensitive matching in match_it()\n   - Permission and path sensitivity\n\n4. Recommended Workflow:\n   a. Inspect current state (look_in())\n   b. Prepare necessary paths (lay_path())\n   c. Create/modify files (write_over(), write_next())\n   d. Verify operations (look_in(), look_back())\n   e. Handle potential errors gracefully\n\n5. Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4. Verify deployment\n   look_in('/tmp/diagnostics')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4. Verify deployment\n   look_in('/tmp/diagnostics')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Filesystem State:\n   - The environment has a volatile filesystem\n   - Files and directories can appear/disappear between operations\n   - Always verify existence before manipulation\n\n2. Function Calling Strategy:\n   - Use look_in() to check current filesystem state\n   - Prepare directories before file operations\n   - Handle potential exceptions\n   - Chain operations carefully\n\n3. Key Constraints:\n   - Extremely strict mode validation for lay_path()\n   - Precise string handling for callback()\n   - Context-sensitive matching in match_it()\n   - Permission and path sensitivity\n\n4. Recommended Workflow:\n   a. Inspect current state (look_in())\n   b. Prepare necessary paths (lay_path())\n   c. Create/modify files (write_over(), write_next())\n   d. Verify operations (look_in(), look_back())\n   e. Handle potential errors gracefully\n\n5. Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4. Verify deployment\n   look_in('/tmp/diagnostics')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Filesystem State:\n   - The environment has a volatile filesystem\n   - Files and directories can appear/disappear between operations\n   - Always verify existence before manipulation\n\n2. Function Calling Strategy:\n   - Use look_in() to check current filesystem state\n   - Prepare directories before file operations\n   - Handle potential exceptions\n   - Chain operations carefully\n\n3. Key Constraints:\n   - Extremely strict mode validation for lay_path()\n   - Precise string handling for callback()\n   - Context-sensitive matching in match_it()\n   - Permission and path sensitivity\n\n4. Recommended Workflow:\n   a. Inspect current state (look_in())\n   b. Prepare necessary paths (lay_path())\n   c. Create/modify files (write_over(), write_next())\n   d. Verify operations (look_in(), look_back())\n   e. Handle potential errors gracefully\n\n5. Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4. Verify deployment\n   look_in('/tmp/diagnostics')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Filesystem State:\n   - The environment has a volatile filesystem\n   - Files and directories can appear/disappear between operations\n   - Always verify existence before manipulation\n\n2. Function Calling Strategy:\n   - Use look_in() to check current filesystem state\n   - Prepare directories before file operations\n   - Handle potential exceptions\n   - Chain operations carefully\n\n3. Key Constraints:\n   - Extremely strict mode validation for lay_path()\n   - Precise string handling for callback()\n   - Context-sensitive matching in match_it()\n   - Permission and path sensitivity\n\n4. Recommended Workflow:\n   a. Inspect current state (look_in())\n   b. Prepare necessary paths (lay_path())\n   c. Create/modify files (write_over(), write_next())\n   d. Verify operations (look_in(), look_back())\n   e. Handle potential errors gracefully\n\n5. Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4.

Filesystem State:\n   - The environment has a volatile filesystem\n   - Files and directories can appear/disappear between operations\n   - Always verify existence before manipulation\n\n2. Function Calling Strategy:\n   - Use look_in() to check current filesystem state\n   - Prepare directories before file operations\n   - Handle potential exceptions\n   - Chain operations carefully\n\n3. Key Constraints:\n   - Extremely strict mode validation for lay_path()\n   - Precise string handling for callback()\n   - Context-sensitive matching in match_it()\n   - Permission and path sensitivity\n\n4. Recommended Workflow:\n   a. Inspect current state (look_in())\n   b. Prepare necessary paths (lay_path())\n   c. Create/modify files (write_over(), write_next())\n   d. Verify operations (look_in(), look_back())\n   e. Handle potential errors gracefully\n\n5. Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4. Verify deployment\n   look_in('/tmp/diagnostics')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Filesystem State:\n   - The environment has a volatile filesystem\n   - Files and directories can appear/disappear between operations\n   - Always verify existence before manipulation\n\n2. Function Calling Strategy:\n   - Use look_in() to check current filesystem state\n   - Prepare directories before file operations\n   - Handle potential exceptions\n   - Chain operations carefully\n\n3. Key Constraints:\n   - Extremely strict mode validation for lay_path()\n   - Precise string handling for callback()\n   - Context-sensitive matching in match_it()\n   - Permission and path sensitivity\n\n4. Recommended Workflow:\n   a. Inspect current state (look_in())\n   b. Prepare necessary paths (lay_path())\n   c. Create/modify files (write_over(), write_next())\n   d. Verify operations (look_in(), look_back())\n   e. Handle potential errors gracefully\n\n5. Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4. Verify deployment\n   look_in('/tmp/diagnostics')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Filesystem State:\n   - The environment has a volatile filesystem\n   - Files and directories can appear/disappear between operations\n   - Always verify existence before manipulation\n\n2. Function Calling Strategy:\n   - Use look_in() to check current filesystem state\n   - Prepare directories before file operations\n   - Handle potential exceptions\n   - Chain operations carefully\n\n3. Key Constraints:\n   - Extremely strict mode validation for lay_path()\n   - Precise string handling for callback()\n   - Context-sensitive matching in match_it()\n   - Permission and path sensitivity\n\n4. Recommended Workflow:\n   a. Inspect current state (look_in())\n   b. Prepare necessary paths (lay_path())\n   c. Create/modify files (write_over(), write_next())\n   d. Verify operations (look_in(), look_back())\n   e. Handle potential errors gracefully\n\n5. Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4. Verify deployment\n   look_in('/tmp/diagnostics')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Filesystem State:\n   - The environment has a volatile filesystem\n   - Files and directories can appear/disappear between operations\n   - Always verify existence before manipulation\n\n2. Function Calling Strategy:\n   - Use look_in() to check current filesystem state\n   - Prepare directories before file operations\n   - Handle potential exceptions\n   - Chain operations carefully\n\n3. Key Constraints:\n   - Extremely strict mode validation for lay_path()\n   - Precise string handling for callback()\n   - Context-sensitive matching in match_it()\n   - Permission and path sensitivity\n\n4. Recommended Workflow:\n   a. Inspect current state (look_in())\n   b. Prepare necessary paths (lay_path())\n   c. Create/modify files (write_over(), write_next())\n   d. Verify operations (look_in(), look_back())\n   e. Handle potential errors gracefully\n\n5. Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4. Verify deployment\n   look_in('/tmp/diagnostics')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Filesystem State:\n   - The environment has a volatile filesystem\n   - Files and directories can appear/disappear between operations\n   - Always verify existence before manipulation\n\n2. Function Calling Strategy:\n   - Use look_in() to check current filesystem state\n   - Prepare directories before file operations\n   - Handle potential exceptions\n   - Chain operations carefully\n\n3. Key Constraints:\n   - Extremely strict mode validation for lay_path()\n   - Precise string handling for callback()\n   - Context-sensitive matching in match_it()\n   - Permission and path sensitivity\n\n4. Recommended Workflow:\n   a. Inspect current state (look_in())\n   b. Prepare necessary paths (lay_path())\n   c. Create/modify files (write_over(), write_next())\n   d. Verify operations (look_in(), look_back())\n   e. Handle potential errors gracefully\n\n5. Debugging:\n   - Use look_back() to understand previous operations\n   - Export environment variables for tracking\n   - Systematic, incremental testing\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: System Configuration Audit\nUser Query: \"Retrieve and analyze system configuration files\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check filesystem state\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Locate configuration files\n   match_it('configuration', 'config.txt')\n\n3. View configuration content\n   view('config.txt')\n\n4. Check file permissions\n   look_in('/', show_perm=True)\n\nScenario 2: Log File Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find and extract log entries about system events\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify log files\n   look_in('/', all=True)\n\n2. Search for event-related entries\n   match_it('event', 'log.txt')\n\n3. Export debug information\n   export_env('LOG_ANALYSIS', 'in_progress')\n\n4. Review operation history\n   look_back()\n\nScenario 3: Script Deployment\nUser Query: \"Create and deploy a diagnostic script\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Prepare destination\n   lay_path('/tmp/diagnostics', mode='')\n\n2. Write script\n   write_over('/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh', '#!/bin/bash\\necho \"System Diagnostic\"')\n\n3. Set executable permissions\n   mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/diagnostics/system_check.sh')\n\n4. Verify deployment\n   look_in('/tmp/diagnostics')\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
