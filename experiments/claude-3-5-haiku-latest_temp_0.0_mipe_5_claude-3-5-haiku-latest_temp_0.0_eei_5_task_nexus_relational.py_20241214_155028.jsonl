Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy. What foods can I eat?\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Get all foods\n```python\nfoods = find_foods_by_name('')\n```\n\n2. Filter foods without dairy\n```python\nsafe_foods = []\nfor food in foods:\n    allergies = get_food_allergic_ingredients(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergies:\n        safe_foods.append(get_food_name(food['id']))\n```\n\nResult: Salad, Sushi, Pasta\n\nExample 2: Weather-based Recommendation\nUser Query: \"I'm in New York and want to know the current weather and time\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find New York location\n```python\nlocations = find_locations_by_name('New York')\nlocation_id = locations[0]['id']\n```\n\n2. Get weather and time\n```python\nweather = get_current_weather_for_location(location_id)\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_for_location(location_id)\n```\n\nResult: \n- Weather: Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\n- Time: 2023-11-14 10:30 AM\n\nExample 3: User Preference Investigation\nUser Query: \"Tell me about Charlie's favorite foods and location\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find Charlie's user info\n```python\ncharlie = find_users_by_name('Charlie')[0]\ncharlie_id = charlie['id']\n```\n\n2. Get favorite foods and location\n```python\nfavorite_food_ids = get_user_favorite_foods(charlie_id)\nfavorite_foods = [get_food_name(food_id) for food_id in favorite_food_ids]\nlocation_id = get_user_location(charlie_id)\nlocation = get_location_info(location_id)\n```\n\nResult:\n- Favorite Foods: Sushi, Salad, Chocolate\n- Location: Chicago\n- Weather: Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy. What foods can I eat?\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Get all foods\n```python\nfoods = find_foods_by_name('')\n```\n\n2. Filter foods without dairy\n```python\nsafe_foods = []\nfor food in foods:\n    allergies = get_food_allergic_ingredients(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergies:\n        safe_foods.append(get_food_name(food['id']))\n```\n\nResult: Salad, Sushi, Pasta\n\nExample 2: Weather-based Recommendation\nUser Query: \"I'm in New York and want to know the current weather and time\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find New York location\n```python\nlocations = find_locations_by_name('New York')\nlocation_id = locations[0]['id']\n```\n\n2. Get weather and time\n```python\nweather = get_current_weather_for_location(location_id)\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_for_location(location_id)\n```\n\nResult: \n- Weather: Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\n- Time: 2023-11-14 10:30 AM\n\nExample 3: User Preference Investigation\nUser Query: \"Tell me about Charlie's favorite foods and location\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find Charlie's user info\n```python\ncharlie = find_users_by_name('Charlie')[0]\ncharlie_id = charlie['id']\n```\n\n2. Get favorite foods and location\n```python\nfavorite_food_ids = get_user_favorite_foods(charlie_id)\nfavorite_foods = [get_food_name(food_id) for food_id in favorite_food_ids]\nlocation_id = get_user_location(charlie_id)\nlocation = get_location_info(location_id)\n```\n\nResult:\n- Favorite Foods: Sushi, Salad, Chocolate\n- Location: Chicago\n- Weather: Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy. What foods can I eat?\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Get all foods\n```python\nfoods = find_foods_by_name('')\n```\n\n2. Filter foods without dairy\n```python\nsafe_foods = []\nfor food in foods:\n    allergies = get_food_allergic_ingredients(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergies:\n        safe_foods.append(get_food_name(food['id']))\n```\n\nResult: Salad, Sushi, Pasta\n\nExample 2: Weather-based Recommendation\nUser Query: \"I'm in New York and want to know the current weather and time\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find New York location\n```python\nlocations = find_locations_by_name('New York')\nlocation_id = locations[0]['id']\n```\n\n2. Get weather and time\n```python\nweather = get_current_weather_for_location(location_id)\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_for_location(location_id)\n```\n\nResult: \n- Weather: Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\n- Time: 2023-11-14 10:30 AM\n\nExample 3: User Preference Investigation\nUser Query: \"Tell me about Charlie's favorite foods and location\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find Charlie's user info\n```python\ncharlie = find_users_by_name('Charlie')[0]\ncharlie_id = charlie['id']\n```\n\n2. Get favorite foods and location\n```python\nfavorite_food_ids = get_user_favorite_foods(charlie_id)\nfavorite_foods = [get_food_name(food_id) for food_id in favorite_food_ids]\nlocation_id = get_user_location(charlie_id)\nlocation = get_location_info(location_id)\n```\n\nResult:\n- Favorite Foods: Sushi, Salad, Chocolate\n- Location: Chicago\n- Weather: Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy.

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy. What foods can I eat?\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Get all foods\n```python\nfoods = find_foods_by_name('')\n```\n\n2. Filter foods without dairy\n```python\nsafe_foods = []\nfor food in foods:\n    allergies = get_food_allergic_ingredients(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergies:\n        safe_foods.append(get_food_name(food['id']))\n```\n\nResult: Salad, Sushi, Pasta\n\nExample 2: Weather-based Recommendation\nUser Query: \"I'm in New York and want to know the current weather and time\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find New York location\n```python\nlocations = find_locations_by_name('New York')\nlocation_id = locations[0]['id']\n```\n\n2. Get weather and time\n```python\nweather = get_current_weather_for_location(location_id)\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_for_location(location_id)\n```\n\nResult: \n- Weather: Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\n- Time: 2023-11-14 10:30 AM\n\nExample 3: User Preference Investigation\nUser Query: \"Tell me about Charlie's favorite foods and location\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find Charlie's user info\n```python\ncharlie = find_users_by_name('Charlie')[0]\ncharlie_id = charlie['id']\n```\n\n2. Get favorite foods and location\n```python\nfavorite_food_ids = get_user_favorite_foods(charlie_id)\nfavorite_foods = [get_food_name(food_id) for food_id in favorite_food_ids]\nlocation_id = get_user_location(charlie_id)\nlocation = get_location_info(location_id)\n```\n\nResult:\n- Favorite Foods: Sushi, Salad, Chocolate\n- Location: Chicago\n- Weather: Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6.

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy. What foods can I eat?\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Get all foods\n```python\nfoods = find_foods_by_name('')\n```\n\n2. Filter foods without dairy\n```python\nsafe_foods = []\nfor food in foods:\n    allergies = get_food_allergic_ingredients(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergies:\n        safe_foods.append(get_food_name(food['id']))\n```\n\nResult: Salad, Sushi, Pasta\n\nExample 2: Weather-based Recommendation\nUser Query: \"I'm in New York and want to know the current weather and time\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find New York location\n```python\nlocations = find_locations_by_name('New York')\nlocation_id = locations[0]['id']\n```\n\n2. Get weather and time\n```python\nweather = get_current_weather_for_location(location_id)\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_for_location(location_id)\n```\n\nResult: \n- Weather: Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\n- Time: 2023-11-14 10:30 AM\n\nExample 3: User Preference Investigation\nUser Query: \"Tell me about Charlie's favorite foods and location\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find Charlie's user info\n```python\ncharlie = find_users_by_name('Charlie')[0]\ncharlie_id = charlie['id']\n```\n\n2. Get favorite foods and location\n```python\nfavorite_food_ids = get_user_favorite_foods(charlie_id)\nfavorite_foods = [get_food_name(food_id) for food_id in favorite_food_ids]\nlocation_id = get_user_location(charlie_id)\nlocation = get_location_info(location_id)\n```\n\nResult:\n- Favorite Foods: Sushi, Salad, Chocolate\n- Location: Chicago\n- Weather: Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy. What foods can I eat?\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Get all foods\n```python\nfoods = find_foods_by_name('')\n```\n\n2. Filter foods without dairy\n```python\nsafe_foods = []\nfor food in foods:\n    allergies = get_food_allergic_ingredients(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergies:\n        safe_foods.append(get_food_name(food['id']))\n```\n\nResult: Salad, Sushi, Pasta\n\nExample 2: Weather-based Recommendation\nUser Query: \"I'm in New York and want to know the current weather and time\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find New York location\n```python\nlocations = find_locations_by_name('New York')\nlocation_id = locations[0]['id']\n```\n\n2. Get weather and time\n```python\nweather = get_current_weather_for_location(location_id)\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_for_location(location_id)\n```\n\nResult: \n- Weather: Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\n- Time: 2023-11-14 10:30 AM\n\nExample 3: User Preference Investigation\nUser Query: \"Tell me about Charlie's favorite foods and location\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find Charlie's user info\n```python\ncharlie = find_users_by_name('Charlie')[0]\ncharlie_id = charlie['id']\n```\n\n2. Get favorite foods and location\n```python\nfavorite_food_ids = get_user_favorite_foods(charlie_id)\nfavorite_foods = [get_food_name(food_id) for food_id in favorite_food_ids]\nlocation_id = get_user_location(charlie_id)\nlocation = get_location_info(location_id)\n```\n\nResult:\n- Favorite Foods: Sushi, Salad, Chocolate\n- Location: Chicago\n- Weather: Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6.

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy. What foods can I eat?\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Get all foods\n```python\nfoods = find_foods_by_name('')\n```\n\n2. Filter foods without dairy\n```python\nsafe_foods = []\nfor food in foods:\n    allergies = get_food_allergic_ingredients(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergies:\n        safe_foods.append(get_food_name(food['id']))\n```\n\nResult: Salad, Sushi, Pasta\n\nExample 2: Weather-based Recommendation\nUser Query: \"I'm in New York and want to know the current weather and time\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find New York location\n```python\nlocations = find_locations_by_name('New York')\nlocation_id = locations[0]['id']\n```\n\n2. Get weather and time\n```python\nweather = get_current_weather_for_location(location_id)\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_for_location(location_id)\n```\n\nResult: \n- Weather: Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\n- Time: 2023-11-14 10:30 AM\n\nExample 3: User Preference Investigation\nUser Query: \"Tell me about Charlie's favorite foods and location\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find Charlie's user info\n```python\ncharlie = find_users_by_name('Charlie')[0]\ncharlie_id = charlie['id']\n```\n\n2. Get favorite foods and location\n```python\nfavorite_food_ids = get_user_favorite_foods(charlie_id)\nfavorite_foods = [get_food_name(food_id) for food_id in favorite_food_ids]\nlocation_id = get_user_location(charlie_id)\nlocation = get_location_info(location_id)\n```\n\nResult:\n- Favorite Foods: Sushi, Salad, Chocolate\n- Location: Chicago\n- Weather: Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy. What foods can I eat?\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Get all foods\n```python\nfoods = find_foods_by_name('')\n```\n\n2. Filter foods without dairy\n```python\nsafe_foods = []\nfor food in foods:\n    allergies = get_food_allergic_ingredients(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergies:\n        safe_foods.append(get_food_name(food['id']))\n```\n\nResult: Salad, Sushi, Pasta\n\nExample 2: Weather-based Recommendation\nUser Query: \"I'm in New York and want to know the current weather and time\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find New York location\n```python\nlocations = find_locations_by_name('New York')\nlocation_id = locations[0]['id']\n```\n\n2. Get weather and time\n```python\nweather = get_current_weather_for_location(location_id)\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_for_location(location_id)\n```\n\nResult: \n- Weather: Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\n- Time: 2023-11-14 10:30 AM\n\nExample 3: User Preference Investigation\nUser Query: \"Tell me about Charlie's favorite foods and location\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find Charlie's user info\n```python\ncharlie = find_users_by_name('Charlie')[0]\ncharlie_id = charlie['id']\n```\n\n2. Get favorite foods and location\n```python\nfavorite_food_ids = get_user_favorite_foods(charlie_id)\nfavorite_foods = [get_food_name(food_id) for food_id in favorite_food_ids]\nlocation_id = get_user_location(charlie_id)\nlocation = get_location_info(location_id)\n```\n\nResult:\n- Favorite Foods: Sushi, Salad, Chocolate\n- Location: Chicago\n- Weather: Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Exploration Strategy:\n   - Start by understanding the current context (current user ID, available users)\n   - Use list_user_ids() to get an overview of the system\n   - Progressively explore users, their locations, and associated information\n\n2. Search and Retrieval:\n   - Most search functions are flexible and case-insensitive\n   - Empty string searches typically return all available items\n   - Partial name matches are supported\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - Non-existent IDs will raise exceptions\n   - Always verify ID existence before detailed queries\n   - Recommended to use try-except blocks when uncertain about ID validity\n\n4. Data Relationships:\n   - Users have locations, favorite foods, colors\n   - Foods have calories and potential allergenic ingredients\n   - Locations have current time and weather\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n   a) Identify the core query requirements\n   b) Determine necessary function calls\n   c) Chain function calls to gather required information\n   d) Handle potential exceptions\n   e) Compile and present results\n\n6. Performance Considerations:\n   - Functions are lightweight and quick\n   - No apparent rate limiting or complex computational overhead\n   - Safe to make multiple sequential calls\n\nLimitations:\n- Fixed set of users, foods, and locations\n- No ability to modify existing data\n- Search is basic (partial, case-insensitive)\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Dietary Restriction Query\nUser Query: \"I'm allergic to dairy. What foods can I eat?\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Get all foods\n```python\nfoods = find_foods_by_name('')\n```\n\n2. Filter foods without dairy\n```python\nsafe_foods = []\nfor food in foods:\n    allergies = get_food_allergic_ingredients(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergies:\n        safe_foods.append(get_food_name(food['id']))\n```\n\nResult: Salad, Sushi, Pasta\n\nExample 2: Weather-based Recommendation\nUser Query: \"I'm in New York and want to know the current weather and time\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find New York location\n```python\nlocations = find_locations_by_name('New York')\nlocation_id = locations[0]['id']\n```\n\n2. Get weather and time\n```python\nweather = get_current_weather_for_location(location_id)\ncurrent_time = get_current_time_for_location(location_id)\n```\n\nResult: \n- Weather: Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\n- Time: 2023-11-14 10:30 AM\n\nExample 3: User Preference Investigation\nUser Query: \"Tell me about Charlie's favorite foods and location\"\n\nSolution Process:\n1. Find Charlie's user info\n```python\ncharlie = find_users_by_name('Charlie')[0]\ncharlie_id = charlie['id']\n```\n\n2. Get favorite foods and location\n```python\nfavorite_food_ids = get_user_favorite_foods(charlie_id)\nfavorite_foods = [get_food_name(food_id) for food_id in favorite_food_ids]\nlocation_id = get_user_location(charlie_id)\nlocation = get_location_info(location_id)\n```\n\nResult:\n- Favorite Foods: Sushi, Salad, Chocolate\n- Location: Chicago\n- Weather: Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
