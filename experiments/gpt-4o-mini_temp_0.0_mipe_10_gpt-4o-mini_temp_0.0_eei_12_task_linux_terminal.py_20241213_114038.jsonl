Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their descriptions to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle common errors such as \"No such file or directory\" or \"Permission denied.\" These errors often indicate that the specified path is incorrect or that the user lacks the necessary permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider testing it with various inputs to observe the outputs and any potential errors. This can help clarify how to use the function correctly.\n\n4. **Command History**: Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands executed. This can provide context for previous actions and help in troubleshooting.\n\n5. **File Management**: When working with files, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist before attempting to read or modify them. Use `look_in()` to verify the contents of directories.\n\n6. **Environment Variables**: Use `export_env()` to set environment variables as needed. This can be useful for configuring the environment for specific tasks.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Keep notes on the functions you use frequently and their expected behaviors. This will help streamline your workflow in the future.\n\n8. **Iterative Approach**: If a function does not yield the expected results, iteratively refine your approach by adjusting the inputs and re-testing.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
