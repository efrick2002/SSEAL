Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

   "To accomplish this task, we'll need to break it down into several steps. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. Create the 'archive' directory in the current working directory.\n2. List the contents of the current directory to find '.log' files.\n3. Move all '.log' files to the 'archive' directory.\n4. List the contents of the 'archive' directory with permissions.\n5. Set the environment variable PERMS to the output of the previous step.\n\nHere's how we can do this using the available functions:\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"archive\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\".\")\nmove_it(\"file1.log\", \"archive/file1.log\")\nmove_it(\"file2.log\", \"archive/file2.log\")\nmove_it(\"file3.log\", \"archive/file3.log\")\nlook_in(\"archive\", show_perm=True)\nexport_env(\"PERMS\", \"\")\n</function_list>\n\nNow, let me explain the reasoning behind each function call:\n\n1. `lay_path(\"archive\", mode=\"dir\")`: This creates the 'archive' directory in the current working directory.\n\n2. `look_in(\".\")`: This lists the contents of the current directory, which will help us identify the '.log' files.\n\n3. `move_it(\"file1.log\", \"archive/file1.log\")`, `move_it(\"file2.log\", \"archive/file2.log\")`, `move_it(\"file3.log\", \"archive/file3.log\")`: These move the '.log' files to the 'archive' directory. Note that we're assuming there are three '.log' files named file1.log, file2.log, and file3.log. In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine the names of the '.log' files based on the output of `look_in(\".\")`.\n\n4. `look_in(\"archive\", show_perm=True)`: This lists the contents of the 'archive' directory with permissions, which we need for the next step.\n\n5. `export_env(\"PERMS\", \"\")`: This sets the environment variable PERMS. However, we can't directly pass the output of `look_in()` to `export_env()`. We'll need to use the output of the previous `look_in(\"archive\", show_perm=True)` call to set this variable correctly in a subsequent step.\n\nAfter we receive the results of these function calls, we'll need to use the output of `look_in(\"archive\", show_perm=True)` to correctly set the PERMS environment variable.

Let's verify:\n\n1. We created the 'archive' directory (done in the first set of function calls).\n2. We moved all '.log' files to the 'archive' directory (done in the second set of function calls).\n3. We listed the contents of the 'archive' directory with permissions (done in the second set of function calls).\n4.

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Set the environment variable PERMS to the output of the previous step.\n\nHere's how we can do this using the available functions:\n\n<function_list>\nlay_path(\"archive\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\".\")\nmove_it(\"file1.log\", \"archive/file1.log\")\nmove_it(\"file2.log\", \"archive/file2.log\")\nmove_it(\"file3.log\", \"archive/file3.log\")\nlook_in(\"archive\", show_perm=True)\nexport_env(\"PERMS\", \"\")\n</function_list>\n\nNow, let me explain the reasoning behind each function call:\n\n1. `lay_path(\"archive\", mode=\"dir\")`: This creates the 'archive' directory in the current working directory.\n\n2. `look_in(\".\")`: This lists the contents of the current directory, which will help us identify the '.log' files.\n\n3. `move_it(\"file1.log\", \"archive/file1.log\")`, `move_it(\"file2.log\", \"archive/file2.log\")`, `move_it(\"file3.log\", \"archive/file3.log\")`: These move the '.log' files to the 'archive' directory. Note that we're assuming there are three '.log' files named file1.log, file2.log, and file3.log. In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine the names of the '.log' files based on the output of `look_in(\".\")`.\n\n4. `look_in(\"archive\", show_perm=True)`: This lists the contents of the 'archive' directory with permissions, which we need for the next step.\n\n5. `export_env(\"PERMS\", \"\")`: This sets the environment variable PERMS. However, we can't directly pass the output of `look_in()` to `export_env()`. We'll need to use the output of the previous `look_in(\"archive\", show_perm=True)` call to set this variable correctly in a subsequent step.\n\nAfter we receive the results of these function calls, we'll need to use the output of `look_in(\"archive\", show_perm=True)` to correctly set the PERMS environment variable.

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
