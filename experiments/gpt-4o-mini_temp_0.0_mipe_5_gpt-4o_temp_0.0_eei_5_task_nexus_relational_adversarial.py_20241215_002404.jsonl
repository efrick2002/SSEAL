Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Most functions require positive integer IDs that correspond to existing records in a dataset. If an ID cannot be resolved, the function will return an error message indicating that the ID is not recognized.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs (e.g., small integers like 1 or 5) to understand their behavior and outputs.\n2. Use iterable inputs for functions that accept them, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets, to explore their capabilities.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input that is not supported or the range of valid IDs.\n4. Document any patterns or consistent behaviors observed across multiple function calls to build a comprehensive understanding of the environment.\n\nFuture agents should use the provided function descriptors to guide their exploration and ensure they are using the correct input types and ranges.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query: \"What is the favorite color of user ID 1?\"\n1. Call `n(1)` to resolve the favorite color for user ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'red'\n\nExample Query: \"What are the details of the food item with ID 5?\"\n1. Call `h(5)` to get the food details for food ID 5.\n   - Expected Output: {'id': 5, 'name': 'Ice Cream', 'calories': 200, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Dairy']}\n\nExample Query: \"What is the current weather in location ID 1?\"\n1. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information for location ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nExample Query: \"List all available food items.\"\n1. Call `c(\"test\")` to get a list of all food items.\n   - Expected Output: [{'id': 6, 'name': 'Pasta'}, ...]\n\nExample Query: \"What are the allergic ingredients in food ID 1?\"\n1. Call `u(1)` to get the list of allergic ingredients for food ID 1.\n   - Expected Output: ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
