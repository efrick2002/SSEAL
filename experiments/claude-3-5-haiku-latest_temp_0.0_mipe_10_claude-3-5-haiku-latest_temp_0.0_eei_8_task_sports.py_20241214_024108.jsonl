Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

   "I'll solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll explore the available tables\n2. I'll need to merge the player table with the team table\n3. Select the relevant columns\n4.

Sort by annual budget in descending order (highest to lowest)\n\nThis approach will give us a comprehensive view of players and their team's budget, sorted from the highest-budget teams to the lowest.",
   "I see the error in my previous approach. The error occurred because I used 'team' which doesn't exist in the DataFrame.

Replaced 'team' with 'team_name' in the select function\n2. Added a limit to show the top 10 results\n3. Kept the sorting by annual budget in descending order\n\nThis should provide a list of players with their team names and team annual budgets, sorted from highest to lowest budget.",
   "The output provides a good overview of players, their team names, and team annual budgets, sorted from highest to lowest. However, I notice a few interesting observations:\n\n1. The Warriors have two players (Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson) on teams with the highest annual budget of $165 million\n2. The Lakers (LeBron James) are third with $150 million\n3. The Celtics (Jayson Tatum) are fourth with $142 million\n\nSince the output seems comprehensive and answers the implied query about players and team budgets, I'll output:\n\n<end_query>\n\nThe data shows the top players from teams with the highest annual budgets, with the Warriors leading at $165 million, followed by the Lakers at $150 million, and the Celtics at $142 million. This gives a clear picture of the financial landscape across different NBA teams."

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
