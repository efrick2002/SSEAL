For example, if a user asks to list the contents of a directory, you can use the `look_in` function to do so.\n\nRemember to always check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks to create a new file\n\n* User query: \"Create a new file called 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello World!'\"\n* Function call: `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n* Response: \"File created successfully\"\n\nExample 2: User asks to list the contents of a directory\n\n* User query: \"List the contents of the directory '/path/to/directory'\"\n* Function call: `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Response: \"Directory contents: file1.txt, file2.txt, ...\"\n\nExample 3: User asks to modify the permissions of a file\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of the file '/path/to/file' to 'rwxrwxrwx'\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/path/to/file')`\n* Response: \"Permissions modified successfully\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, if a user asks to list the contents of a directory, you can use the `look_in` function to do so.\n\nRemember to always check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks to create a new file\n\n* User query: \"Create a new file called 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello World!'\"\n* Function call: `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n* Response: \"File created successfully\"\n\nExample 2: User asks to list the contents of a directory\n\n* User query: \"List the contents of the directory '/path/to/directory'\"\n* Function call: `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Response: \"Directory contents: file1.txt, file2.txt, ...\"\n\nExample 3: User asks to modify the permissions of a file\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of the file '/path/to/file' to 'rwxrwxrwx'\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/path/to/file')`\n* Response: \"Permissions modified successfully\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, if a user asks to list the contents of a directory, you can use the `look_in` function to do so.\n\nRemember to always check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks to create a new file\n\n* User query: \"Create a new file called 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello World!'\"\n* Function call: `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n* Response: \"File created successfully\"\n\nExample 2: User asks to list the contents of a directory\n\n* User query: \"List the contents of the directory '/path/to/directory'\"\n* Function call: `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Response: \"Directory contents: file1.txt, file2.txt, ...\"\n\nExample 3: User asks to modify the permissions of a file\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of the file '/path/to/file' to 'rwxrwxrwx'\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/path/to/file')`\n* Response: \"Permissions modified successfully\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, if a user asks to list the contents of a directory, you can use the `look_in` function to do so.\n\nRemember to always check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks to create a new file\n\n* User query: \"Create a new file called 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello World!'\"\n* Function call: `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n* Response: \"File created successfully\"\n\nExample 2: User asks to list the contents of a directory\n\n* User query: \"List the contents of the directory '/path/to/directory'\"\n* Function call: `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Response: \"Directory contents: file1.txt, file2.txt, ...\"\n\nExample 3: User asks to modify the permissions of a file\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of the file '/path/to/file' to 'rwxrwxrwx'\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/path/to/file')`\n* Response: \"Permissions modified successfully\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, if a user asks to list the contents of a directory, you can use the `look_in` function to do so.\n\nRemember to always check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks to create a new file\n\n* User query: \"Create a new file called 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello World!'\"\n* Function call: `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n* Response: \"File created successfully\"\n\nExample 2: User asks to list the contents of a directory\n\n* User query: \"List the contents of the directory '/path/to/directory'\"\n* Function call: `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Response: \"Directory contents: file1.txt, file2.txt, ...\"\n\nExample 3: User asks to modify the permissions of a file\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of the file '/path/to/file' to 'rwxrwxrwx'\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/path/to/file')`\n* Response: \"Permissions modified successfully\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, if a user asks to list the contents of a directory, you can use the `look_in` function to do so.\n\nRemember to always check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks to create a new file\n\n* User query: \"Create a new file called 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello World!'\"\n* Function call: `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n* Response: \"File created successfully\"\n\nExample 2: User asks to list the contents of a directory\n\n* User query: \"List the contents of the directory '/path/to/directory'\"\n* Function call: `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Response: \"Directory contents: file1.txt, file2.txt, ...\"\n\nExample 3: User asks to modify the permissions of a file\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of the file '/path/to/file' to 'rwxrwxrwx'\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/path/to/file')`\n* Response: \"Permissions modified successfully\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, if a user asks to list the contents of a directory, you can use the `look_in` function to do so.\n\nRemember to always check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks to create a new file\n\n* User query: \"Create a new file called 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello World!'\"\n* Function call: `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n* Response: \"File created successfully\"\n\nExample 2: User asks to list the contents of a directory\n\n* User query: \"List the contents of the directory '/path/to/directory'\"\n* Function call: `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Response: \"Directory contents: file1.txt, file2.txt, ...\"\n\nExample 3: User asks to modify the permissions of a file\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of the file '/path/to/file' to 'rwxrwxrwx'\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/path/to/file')`\n* Response: \"Permissions modified successfully\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, if a user asks to list the contents of a directory, you can use the `look_in` function to do so.\n\nRemember to always check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks to create a new file\n\n* User query: \"Create a new file called 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello World!'\"\n* Function call: `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n* Response: \"File created successfully\"\n\nExample 2: User asks to list the contents of a directory\n\n* User query: \"List the contents of the directory '/path/to/directory'\"\n* Function call: `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Response: \"Directory contents: file1.txt, file2.txt, ...\"\n\nExample 3: User asks to modify the permissions of a file\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of the file '/path/to/file' to 'rwxrwxrwx'\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/path/to/file')`\n* Response: \"Permissions modified successfully\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
