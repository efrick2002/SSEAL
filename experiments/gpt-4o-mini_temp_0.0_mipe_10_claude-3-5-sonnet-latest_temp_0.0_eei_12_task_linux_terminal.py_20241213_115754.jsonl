Permissions:\n- Default permissions: rwxr-xr-x for dirs, rw-r--r-- for files\n- super() required for destory() and mod_perms()\n- Permissions persist between operations\n\n3.

Content Handling:\n- Preserves all whitespace including newlines\n- Handles Unicode content\n- No automatic newline handling\n- Binary content supported\n\n5. Pattern Matching:\n- match_it() uses literal string matching (not regex)\n- Case-sensitive matching\n- Shows filename:line for matches\n\nBest Practices:\n1.

File Operations:\n- write_over() creates files if they don't exist\n- write_next() appends without adding newlines\n- move_it() overwrites destination if it exists\n- destory() requires recursive=True for directories\n\n4. Content Handling:\n- Preserves all whitespace including newlines\n- Handles Unicode content\n- No automatic newline handling\n- Binary content supported\n\n5. Pattern Matching:\n- match_it() uses literal string matching (not regex)\n- Case-sensitive matching\n- Shows filename:line for matches\n\nBest Practices:\n1.

Path Handling:\n- Supports both relative and absolute paths\n- Automatically creates parent directories when needed\n- Normalizes multiple slashes (/// -> /)\n- Handles spaces and special characters in paths\n\n2. Permissions:\n- Default permissions: rwxr-xr-x for dirs, rw-r--r-- for files\n- super() required for destory() and mod_perms()\n- Permissions persist between operations\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_over() creates files if they don't exist\n- write_next() appends without adding newlines\n- move_it() overwrites destination if it exists\n- destory() requires recursive=True for directories\n\n4. Content Handling:\n- Preserves all whitespace including newlines\n- Handles Unicode content\n- No automatic newline handling\n- Binary content supported\n\n5. Pattern Matching:\n- match_it() uses literal string matching (not regex)\n- Case-sensitive matching\n- Shows filename:line for matches\n\nBest Practices:\n1. Always check permissions before destructive operations\n2. Use super() before permission changes\n3. Verify file existence before operations\n4. Handle paths consistently (prefer relative when possible)\n5. Be explicit about newlines in content\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of all text files\"\n```python\n# List current directory\nlook_in(\".\", all=True)\n# Create backup directory\nlay_path(\"backup\", mode=\"dir\")\n# Find all .txt files\nmatch_it(\".txt\", \"*\")\n# Copy each file (using move_it with view to preserve content)\nwrite_over(\"backup/file.txt\", view(\"file.txt\"))\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Set up a protected directory structure\"\n```python\n# Create directory structure\nlay_path(\"secure/private\", mode=\"dir\")\nwrite_over(\"secure/private/secret.txt\", \"confidential\")\n# Set restrictive permissions\nsuper()\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"secure\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"secure/private\")\nmod_perms(\"rw-------\", \"secure/private/secret.txt\")\n# Verify permissions\nlook_in(\"secure\", show_perm=True)\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Append timestamps to log file\"\n```python\n# Create/append to log\nwrite_over(\"log.txt\", \"Start\\n\")\nwrite_next(\"log.txt\", \"Entry 1\\n\")\nwrite_next(\"log.txt\", \"Entry 2\\n\")\n# Verify content\nview(\"log.txt\")\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
