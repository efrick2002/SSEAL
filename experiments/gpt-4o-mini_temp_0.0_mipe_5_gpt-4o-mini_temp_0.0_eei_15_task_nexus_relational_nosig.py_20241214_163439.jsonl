Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries. Familiarize yourself with the expected return types to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid or if the requested data cannot be found (e.g., non-existent user IDs). Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries. Familiarize yourself with the expected return types to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid or if the requested data cannot be found (e.g., non-existent user IDs). Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries. Familiarize yourself with the expected return types to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid or if the requested data cannot be found (e.g., non-existent user IDs). Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries. Familiarize yourself with the expected return types to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid or if the requested data cannot be found (e.g., non-existent user IDs). Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries. Familiarize yourself with the expected return types to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid or if the requested data cannot be found (e.g., non-existent user IDs). Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries. Familiarize yourself with the expected return types to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid or if the requested data cannot be found (e.g., non-existent user IDs). Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries. Familiarize yourself with the expected return types to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid or if the requested data cannot be found (e.g., non-existent user IDs). Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Many functions return lists of dictionaries, while others return single values or dictionaries. Familiarize yourself with the expected return types to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid or if the requested data cannot be found (e.g., non-existent user IDs). Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Always check the available user IDs using `list_user_ids()` if you encounter such errors.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by gathering broad information (e.g., user IDs, food names) and then drill down into specific details (e.g., user info, food allergies). This approach helps build context and reduces the number of ambiguous calls.\n\n4. **Function Dependencies**: Some functions depend on the results of others. For example, to get a user's favorite foods, you first need to retrieve the user ID. Keep track of the relationships between functions to streamline your queries.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for clarity on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and examples.\n\n6. **Iterative Testing**: If uncertain about a function's behavior, perform iterative testing with different inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify ambiguities and improve understanding.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
