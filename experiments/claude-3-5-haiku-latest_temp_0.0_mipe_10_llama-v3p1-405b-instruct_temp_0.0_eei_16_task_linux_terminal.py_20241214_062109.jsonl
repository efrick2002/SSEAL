Be careful when using functions that modify files or directories, as they can have unintended consequences.\n\nWhen using the `destory` function, make sure to specify the correct path and recursive and force flags to avoid accidentally removing important files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `lay_path` function, make sure to specify the correct mode to avoid creating a file or directory with incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `look_in` function, make sure to specify the correct path and flags to avoid listing incorrect files or directories.\n\nWhen using the `match_it` function, make sure to specify the correct pattern and files to avoid searching for incorrect patterns.\n\nWhen using the `mod_perms` function, make sure to specify the correct permission string and path to avoid setting incorrect permissions.\n\nWhen using the `move_it` function, make sure to specify the correct source and destination paths to avoid moving files or directories to incorrect locations.\n\nWhen using the `view` function, make sure to specify the correct files to avoid displaying incorrect contents.\n\nWhen using the `write_next` and `write_over` functions, make sure to specify the correct filename and content to avoid writing to incorrect files.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of these functions to gather information and perform actions. For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, you can use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory, and then use the `view` function to display the contents of a specific file.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n* User query: Create a new file called \"new_file.txt\" and write \"Hello, world!\" to it.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n\t+ write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, world!')\n* Output: None\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory and display the contents of a specific file.\n\n* User query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/existing_directory\" directory and display the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ look_in('/path/to/existing_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n\t+ view('existing_file.txt')\n* Output: List of files and directories in the directory, and the contents of the \"existing_file.txt\" file.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in files and display the matching files.\n\n* User query: Search for the \"*.txt\" pattern in the \"existing_file.txt\" and \"another_file.txt\" files and display the matching files.\n* Function calls:\n\t+ match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt', 'another_file.txt')\n* Output: List of matching files.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
