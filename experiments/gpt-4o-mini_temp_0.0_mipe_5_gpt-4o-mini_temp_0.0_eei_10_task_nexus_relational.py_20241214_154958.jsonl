Use example inputs provided in the function documentation.\n\n4. **Iterative Approach**: When answering user queries, take an iterative approach. Start with broad queries (e.g., finding foods by name) and narrow down based on the results.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of each function's purpose, expected inputs, outputs, and any observed error cases.\n\n6. **Testing**: Use the environment to test various scenarios, especially edge cases, to ensure that the functions behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Use example inputs provided in the function documentation.\n\n4. **Iterative Approach**: When answering user queries, take an iterative approach. Start with broad queries (e.g., finding foods by name) and narrow down based on the results.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of each function's purpose, expected inputs, outputs, and any observed error cases.\n\n6. **Testing**: Use the environment to test various scenarios, especially edge cases, to ensure that the functions behave as expected.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.
