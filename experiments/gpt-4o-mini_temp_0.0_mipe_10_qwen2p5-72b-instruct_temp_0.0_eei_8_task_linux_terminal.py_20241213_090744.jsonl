Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Ensure the `mode` parameter is correctly set to 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - Use `destory` to delete files or directories. Be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters to avoid unintended deletions.\n  - Use `move_it` to move files or directories. Ensure the source and destination paths are valid.\n  - Use `mod_perms` to modify file or directory permissions. The `mode` parameter must be a 9-character string.\n\n- **Environment Variables**:\n  - Use `export_env` to set environment variables. This function does not return any output but should be verified using other means (e.g., checking the environment).\n\n- **File Content Operations**:\n  - Use `write_next` to append content to a file.\n  - Use `write_over` to overwrite the content of a file.\n  - Use `view` to display the contents of one or more files.\n\n- **Pattern Matching**:\n  - Use `match_it` to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist before calling this function.\n\n- **Command History**:\n  - Use `look_back` to retrieve the history of commands executed in the environment. This can be useful for debugging and verifying the sequence of operations.\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the operation is not permitted. Always check the existence and permissions of files and directories before calling these functions.\n  - The `lay_path` function raises an exception if the `mode` parameter is not 'file' or 'directory'.\n  - The `mod_perms` function raises an assertion error if the `mode` parameter is not a 9-character string.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set an environment variable and check the command history.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set an environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('NEW_VAR', 'new_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to a file, then overwrite the file with new content, and finally view the contents of the file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Appending some content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - Overwrite the file with new content:\n     <function_list>\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Overwriting with new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, then create a new file, and modify its permissions.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and all its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Create a new file:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Modify the permissions of the new file:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I want to search for a specific pattern in multiple files and list the contents of a directory with permissions shown.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Search for a pattern in multiple files:\n     <function_list>\n     match_it('specific_pattern', '/path/to/valid_file1.txt', '/path/to/valid_file2.log')\n     </function_list>\n   - List the contents of a directory with permissions shown:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view the contents of the moved file.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the file to a new location:\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the contents of the moved file:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
