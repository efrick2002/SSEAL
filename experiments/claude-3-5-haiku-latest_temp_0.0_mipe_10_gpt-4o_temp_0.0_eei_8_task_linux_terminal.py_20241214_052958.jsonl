Many functions rely on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not. When testing functions, consider creating necessary files or directories using `lay_path` before attempting operations on them. Additionally, be aware of permission settings, as some operations may require elevated permissions or the use of the `force` option.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that provide information, such as `look_in` and `look_back`, to understand the current state and history of the environment. This can help in setting up the correct context for further operations.\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues with file or directory existence, verify the current working directory and ensure that paths are correctly specified relative to it.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Deleting a Directory**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='directory')` to create a directory if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `destory('/path/to/directory', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Viewing File Contents**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/file', mode='file')` to create a file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `write_over('/path/to/file', 'Sample content')` to add content to the file.\n3. Use `view('/path/to/file')` to display the contents of the file.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I move a file from one location to another?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/source_file', mode='file')` to create a source file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `move_it('/path/to/source_file', '/path/to/destination_file')` to move the file to a new location.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions rely on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not. When testing functions, consider creating necessary files or directories using `lay_path` before attempting operations on them. Additionally, be aware of permission settings, as some operations may require elevated permissions or the use of the `force` option.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that provide information, such as `look_in` and `look_back`, to understand the current state and history of the environment. This can help in setting up the correct context for further operations.\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues with file or directory existence, verify the current working directory and ensure that paths are correctly specified relative to it.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Deleting a Directory**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='directory')` to create a directory if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `destory('/path/to/directory', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Viewing File Contents**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/file', mode='file')` to create a file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `write_over('/path/to/file', 'Sample content')` to add content to the file.\n3. Use `view('/path/to/file')` to display the contents of the file.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I move a file from one location to another?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/source_file', mode='file')` to create a source file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `move_it('/path/to/source_file', '/path/to/destination_file')` to move the file to a new location.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Many functions rely on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not. When testing functions, consider creating necessary files or directories using `lay_path` before attempting operations on them. Additionally, be aware of permission settings, as some operations may require elevated permissions or the use of the `force` option.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that provide information, such as `look_in` and `look_back`, to understand the current state and history of the environment. This can help in setting up the correct context for further operations.\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues with file or directory existence, verify the current working directory and ensure that paths are correctly specified relative to it.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Deleting a Directory**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='directory')` to create a directory if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `destory('/path/to/directory', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Viewing File Contents**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/file', mode='file')` to create a file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `write_over('/path/to/file', 'Sample content')` to add content to the file.\n3. Use `view('/path/to/file')` to display the contents of the file.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I move a file from one location to another?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/source_file', mode='file')` to create a source file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `move_it('/path/to/source_file', '/path/to/destination_file')` to move the file to a new location.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions rely on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not. When testing functions, consider creating necessary files or directories using `lay_path` before attempting operations on them. Additionally, be aware of permission settings, as some operations may require elevated permissions or the use of the `force` option.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that provide information, such as `look_in` and `look_back`, to understand the current state and history of the environment. This can help in setting up the correct context for further operations.\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues with file or directory existence, verify the current working directory and ensure that paths are correctly specified relative to it.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Deleting a Directory**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='directory')` to create a directory if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `destory('/path/to/directory', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Viewing File Contents**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/file', mode='file')` to create a file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `write_over('/path/to/file', 'Sample content')` to add content to the file.\n3. Use `view('/path/to/file')` to display the contents of the file.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I move a file from one location to another?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/source_file', mode='file')` to create a source file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `move_it('/path/to/source_file', '/path/to/destination_file')` to move the file to a new location.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions rely on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not. When testing functions, consider creating necessary files or directories using `lay_path` before attempting operations on them. Additionally, be aware of permission settings, as some operations may require elevated permissions or the use of the `force` option.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that provide information, such as `look_in` and `look_back`, to understand the current state and history of the environment. This can help in setting up the correct context for further operations.\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues with file or directory existence, verify the current working directory and ensure that paths are correctly specified relative to it.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Deleting a Directory**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='directory')` to create a directory if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `destory('/path/to/directory', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Viewing File Contents**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/file', mode='file')` to create a file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `write_over('/path/to/file', 'Sample content')` to add content to the file.\n3. Use `view('/path/to/file')` to display the contents of the file.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I move a file from one location to another?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/source_file', mode='file')` to create a source file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `move_it('/path/to/source_file', '/path/to/destination_file')` to move the file to a new location.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions rely on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not. When testing functions, consider creating necessary files or directories using `lay_path` before attempting operations on them. Additionally, be aware of permission settings, as some operations may require elevated permissions or the use of the `force` option.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that provide information, such as `look_in` and `look_back`, to understand the current state and history of the environment. This can help in setting up the correct context for further operations.\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues with file or directory existence, verify the current working directory and ensure that paths are correctly specified relative to it.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Deleting a Directory**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='directory')` to create a directory if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `destory('/path/to/directory', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Viewing File Contents**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/file', mode='file')` to create a file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `write_over('/path/to/file', 'Sample content')` to add content to the file.\n3. Use `view('/path/to/file')` to display the contents of the file.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I move a file from one location to another?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/source_file', mode='file')` to create a source file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `move_it('/path/to/source_file', '/path/to/destination_file')` to move the file to a new location.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions rely on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not. When testing functions, consider creating necessary files or directories using `lay_path` before attempting operations on them. Additionally, be aware of permission settings, as some operations may require elevated permissions or the use of the `force` option.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that provide information, such as `look_in` and `look_back`, to understand the current state and history of the environment. This can help in setting up the correct context for further operations.\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues with file or directory existence, verify the current working directory and ensure that paths are correctly specified relative to it.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Deleting a Directory**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='directory')` to create a directory if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `destory('/path/to/directory', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Viewing File Contents**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/file', mode='file')` to create a file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `write_over('/path/to/file', 'Sample content')` to add content to the file.\n3. Use `view('/path/to/file')` to display the contents of the file.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I move a file from one location to another?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/source_file', mode='file')` to create a source file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `move_it('/path/to/source_file', '/path/to/destination_file')` to move the file to a new location.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions rely on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not. When testing functions, consider creating necessary files or directories using `lay_path` before attempting operations on them. Additionally, be aware of permission settings, as some operations may require elevated permissions or the use of the `force` option.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that provide information, such as `look_in` and `look_back`, to understand the current state and history of the environment. This can help in setting up the correct context for further operations.\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues with file or directory existence, verify the current working directory and ensure that paths are correctly specified relative to it.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Deleting a Directory**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='directory')` to create a directory if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `destory('/path/to/directory', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Viewing File Contents**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/file', mode='file')` to create a file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `write_over('/path/to/file', 'Sample content')` to add content to the file.\n3. Use `view('/path/to/file')` to display the contents of the file.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I move a file from one location to another?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/source_file', mode='file')` to create a source file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `move_it('/path/to/source_file', '/path/to/destination_file')` to move the file to a new location.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions rely on the existence of files or directories, and will return errors if they do not. When testing functions, consider creating necessary files or directories using `lay_path` before attempting operations on them. Additionally, be aware of permission settings, as some operations may require elevated permissions or the use of the `force` option.\n\nWhen exploring the environment, start by using functions that provide information, such as `look_in` and `look_back`, to understand the current state and history of the environment. This can help in setting up the correct context for further operations.\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues with file or directory existence, verify the current working directory and ensure that paths are correctly specified relative to it.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n\n**Example 1: Deleting a Directory**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='directory')` to create a directory if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `destory('/path/to/directory', recursive=True, force=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n**Example 2: Viewing File Contents**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/file', mode='file')` to create a file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `write_over('/path/to/file', 'Sample content')` to add content to the file.\n3. Use `view('/path/to/file')` to display the contents of the file.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a File**\n\nUser Query: \"How can I move a file from one location to another?\"\n\n1. Use `lay_path('/path/to/source_file', mode='file')` to create a source file if it doesn't exist.\n2. Use `move_it('/path/to/source_file', '/path/to/destination_file')` to move the file to a new location.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
