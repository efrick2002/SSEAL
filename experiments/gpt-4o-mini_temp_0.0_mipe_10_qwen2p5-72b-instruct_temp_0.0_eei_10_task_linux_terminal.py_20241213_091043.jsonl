Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1.

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1.

Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3.

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided are correct and that the files or directories exist before calling these functions.\n   - The `mod_perms` function requires a 9-character mode string. Ensure the mode is correctly formatted to avoid `AssertionError`.\n   - The `lay_path` function only accepts 'file' or 'directory' as valid modes. Using any other mode will result in an `Exception`.\n\n3. **Function Usage**:\n   - **callback**: Use this function to concatenate strings. It is useful for generating messages or combining multiple pieces of text.\n   - **destory**: Use this function to delete files or directories. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the path is correct.\n   - **export_env**: Use this function to set environment variables. This is useful for configuring the environment or passing variables to other processes.\n   - **lay_path**: Use this function to create files or directories. Ensure the mode is either 'file' or 'directory'.\n   - **look_back**: Use this function to view the command history. This can help in debugging and understanding the sequence of operations.\n   - **look_in**: Use this function to list the contents of a directory. Ensure the path is a valid directory.\n   - **match_it**: Use this function to search for patterns in files. Ensure the files exist and the pattern is correctly specified.\n   - **mod_perms**: Use this function to modify file permissions. Ensure the mode is a 9-character string and the file exists.\n   - **move_it**: Use this function to move files or directories. Ensure the source path exists and the destination path is valid.\n   - **super**: This function is a placeholder and does not perform any action. It can be used for testing or as a no-op.\n   - **view**: Use this function to display the contents of files. Ensure the files exist.\n   - **write_next**: Use this function to append content to a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n   - **write_over**: Use this function to overwrite the content of a file. Ensure the file exists and the content is a string.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use the `look_back()` function to review the history of commands and their outputs, which can help in debugging and verifying the state of the environment.\n   - When setting environment variables, ensure the variable names are meaningful and the values are appropriate for the context.\n   - When creating files or directories, use the correct mode ('file' or 'directory') to avoid exceptions.\n   - When modifying permissions, ensure the mode string is exactly 9 characters long.\n   - When moving files, ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to delete a directory and all its contents, even if there are permission issues.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Verify the directory exists and is accessible.\n     2. Call the `destory` function with the appropriate parameters.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the operation.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory exists and its contents\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)  # Delete the directory and all its contents\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to set an environment variable for the current session and verify it.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `export_env` function to set the environment variable.\n     2. Use `look_back` to verify the command history and ensure the variable was set.\n\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('SESSION', 'active')  # Set the environment variable\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the variable was set\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `lay_path` function to create the directory.\n     2. Call the `lay_path` function again to create the file inside the directory.\n     3. Call the `mod_perms` function to set the file's permissions.\n     4. Use `look_in` to verify the directory and file contents and permissions.\n\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')  # Create the directory\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')  # Create the file inside the directory\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')  # Set the file's permissions\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the directory and file contents and permissions\n     </function_list>\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to move a file to a new location and then view its contents.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `move_it` function to move the file.\n     2. Call the `view` function to display the contents of the moved file.\n     3. Use `look_back` to verify the command history.\n\n     <function_list>\n     move_it('/path/to/valid_source', '/path/to/valid_destination')  # Move the file\n     view('/path/to/valid_destination')  # View the contents of the moved file\n     look_back()  # Review the command history to verify the operation\n     </function_list>\n\n5. **User Query**: \"I need to append some content to a file and then overwrite it with new content.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Call the `write_next` function to append content to the file.\n     2. Call the `write_over` function to overwrite the file with new content.\n     3. Use `view` to verify the final content of the file.\n\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Additional content to append.')  # Append content to the file\n     write_over('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'Final content overwrite.')  # Overwrite the file with new content\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')  # Verify the final content of the file\n     </function_list>\n\n6. **User Query**: \"I need to search for a specific pattern in multiple log files and display the results.\"\n   - **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n     1. Ensure the log files exist.\n     2. Call the `match_it` function to search for the pattern in the log files.\n     3. Use `view` to display the contents of the log files if needed.\n\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/log_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify the log files exist\n     match_it('error', '/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Search for the pattern 'error'\n     view('/path/to/log_directory/log1.log', '/path/to/log_directory/log2.log')  # Display the contents of the log files\n     </function_list>\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
