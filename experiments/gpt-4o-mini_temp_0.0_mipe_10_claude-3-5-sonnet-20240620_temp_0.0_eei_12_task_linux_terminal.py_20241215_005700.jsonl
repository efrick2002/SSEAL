Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4.

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Environment Interaction:\n   - All interactions with the environment must be done through the provided functions.\n   - Function calls should be wrapped in <function_list> tags when submitting to the environment.\n   - The environment will return results as a list of dictionaries, each containing 'call' and 'result' keys.\n\n2. File System Navigation:\n   - Use look_in() to explore directory contents.\n   - Remember that the root directory is '/' and '/tmp' is commonly used for temporary files.\n\n3. File Operations:\n   - Always check if a file/directory exists before operating on it.\n   - Use lay_path() to create files or directories.\n   - Use destory() to remove files or directories, remembering to use recursive=True for non-empty directories.\n\n4. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change permissions, always specifying the full 9-character mode.\n   - The super() function may be needed before certain privileged operations.\n\n5. Environment Variables:\n   - Variables set with export_env() are not directly accessible. Use them in shell scripts or commands.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - match_it() function does not support regex. It performs simple string matching.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - Use look_back() to view command history, which can be useful for debugging or understanding past actions.\n\n8. Error Handling:\n   - Always check for exceptions in the function results.\n   - Some operations may fail silently, so verify the results of each operation.\n\nWhen answering user queries:\n1. Break down the query into steps that can be accomplished with the available functions.\n2. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the current state of the system.\n3. Utilize write_over() and write_next() to create or modify files as needed.\n4. Use match_it() to search for specific content in files.\n5. Remember to use super() before attempting privileged operations.\n6. Always verify the results of each operation before proceeding to the next step.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' in /tmp with the content 'Hello, World!', then change its permissions to read-only for all users.\"\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\nview(\"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nmod_perms(\"r--r--r--\", \"/tmp/hello.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use write_over() to create and write to the file.\n2. We verify the content with view().\n3. We change permissions with mod_perms().\n4. We verify the changes with look_in().\n\nExample 2: \"Find all files in /tmp that contain the word 'error' and append 'Checked' to each of them.\"\n\n<function_list>\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\nmatch_it(\"error\", \"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"/tmp/file3.log\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file1.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file2.txt\", \"Checked\")\nwrite_next(\"/tmp/file3.log\", \"Checked\")\nview(\"/tmp/file1.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file2.txt\")\nview(\"/tmp/file3.log\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We list the contents of /tmp to know what files exist.\n2. We search for \"error\" in all files (assuming these are the files in /tmp).\n3. We append \"Checked\" to each file that might contain \"error\".\n4. We view the contents of each file to verify the changes.\n\nNote: In a real scenario, we would need to dynamically determine which files to check and modify based on the match_it() results.\n\nExample 3: \"Create a new directory in /root and set its permissions to only allow root access.\"\n\n<function_list>\nsuper()\nlay_path(\"/root/secure_dir\", mode=\"dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\")\nmod_perms(\"rwx------\", \"/root/secure_dir\")\nlook_in(\"/root\", show_perm=True)\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation:\n1. We use super() to gain elevated privileges.\n2. We create the directory with lay_path().\n3. We verify the directory was created with look_in().\n4. We modify the permissions with mod_perms().\n5. We verify the permissions with look_in(show_perm=True).\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
