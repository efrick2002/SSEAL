Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the functions provided to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. Each function has a specific purpose and takes specific arguments.\n\nWhen calling a function, make sure to provide the correct arguments and data types. For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the functions provided to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. Each function has a specific purpose and takes specific arguments.\n\nWhen calling a function, make sure to provide the correct arguments and data types. For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the functions provided to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. Each function has a specific purpose and takes specific arguments.\n\nWhen calling a function, make sure to provide the correct arguments and data types. For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

interact with this environment, you can use the functions provided to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. Each function has a specific purpose and takes specific arguments.\n\nWhen calling a function, make sure to provide the correct arguments and data types. For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

interact with this environment, you can use the functions provided to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. Each function has a specific purpose and takes specific arguments.\n\nWhen calling a function, make sure to provide the correct arguments and data types. For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the functions provided to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. Each function has a specific purpose and takes specific arguments.\n\nWhen calling a function, make sure to provide the correct arguments and data types. For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the functions provided to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. Each function has a specific purpose and takes specific arguments.\n\nWhen calling a function, make sure to provide the correct arguments and data types. For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the functions provided to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. Each function has a specific purpose and takes specific arguments.\n\nWhen calling a function, make sure to provide the correct arguments and data types. For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the functions provided to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. Each function has a specific purpose and takes specific arguments.\n\nWhen calling a function, make sure to provide the correct arguments and data types. For example, when calling the `f` function to retrieve user information, you need to provide a valid user ID as an integer.\n\nSome functions may return error messages if the provided arguments are invalid or not found. Make sure to handle these error cases accordingly.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the required information. For example, to answer a query about the current weather in a specific location, you can use the `q` function to retrieve the current weather and the `g` function to retrieve the location information.\n\nMake sure to read the docstrings and observed error cases for each function to understand their behavior and limitations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Retrieve the current weather in New York\n\n* Call the `g` function to retrieve the location information for New York: `g(1)`\n* Call the `q` function to retrieve the current weather for the location: `q(1)`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 2: Retrieve the favorite food of a user\n\n* Call the `f` function to retrieve the user information: `f(1)`\n* Extract the favorite food ID from the user information: `favorite_foods[0]`\n* Call the `t` function to retrieve the name of the favorite food: `t(favorite_foods[0])`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The favorite food of the user is Pizza.\"\n\nExample 3: Retrieve the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `z` function to retrieve the list of users: `z({'name': 'Alice'})`\n* Extract the user IDs from the list of users: `[user['id'] for user in users]`\n* Call the `m` function to retrieve the list of food IDs for each user: `[m(user_id) for user_id in user_ids]`\n* Combine the results to answer the user query: \"The list of users who like Pizza is [1, 2, 3].\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
