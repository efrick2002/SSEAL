Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4.

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1.

Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Initial Exploration\n- Always start by running ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering with simple conditions\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n- Use calculate_column() for basic column creation (limited capabilities)\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- Utilize execute_operations() for complex, multi-step data transformations\n- Carefully structure operations to avoid errors\n\n5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- Avoid complex conditional logic in calculate_column()\n- Use simple, direct comparisons in select()\n- Be aware of limited mathematical operations\n- Always verify column names and data types\n\n6. Debugging Approach\n- If an operation fails, break it down into smaller steps\n- Check column existence and data types\n- Use simple, direct transformations\n- Verify each step's output\n\nRecommended Workflow:\n1. List tables (ls())\n2. Get metadata (get_metadata())\n3. Read specific table (read_db())\n4. Filter/transform data (select(), aggregate())\n5. Combine tables if needed (merge_tables())\n6. Limit or sort results (limit(), sort())\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Analyzing Player Salaries by Position\n\nUser Query: \"What are the average salaries for each position, focusing on players over 30?\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Filter players over 30\n```python\nexperienced_players = select(players, conditions={'age': ('>=', 30)})\n```\n\n3. Aggregate salaries by position\n```python\nsalary_by_position = aggregate(\n    experienced_players, \n    group_by='position', \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], \n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Performance Analysis\n\nUser Query: \"Compare team performance by looking at team stats and player information\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read necessary tables\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\nteam_stats = read_db('team_stats.tbl')\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Merge player and team stats\n```python\nmerged_data = merge_tables(players, team_stats, on='team_id')\n```\n\n3. Aggregate performance metrics\n```python\nteam_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data, \n    group_by='team_id', \n    agg_dict={\n        'points_per_game': ['mean'],\n        'salary': ['mean'],\n        'age': ['median']\n    }\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort and limit results\n```python\ntop_performing_teams = sort(\n    team_performance, \n    columns='points_per_game', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3_teams = limit(top_performing_teams, 3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to navigate the environment, chain operations, and extract meaningful insights from the data.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
