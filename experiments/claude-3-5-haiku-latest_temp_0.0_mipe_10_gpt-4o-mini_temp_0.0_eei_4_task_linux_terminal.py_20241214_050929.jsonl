Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found).

This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found).

This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand Function Behavior**: Each function has specific input requirements and expected outputs. Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their documented behaviors to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle exceptions and errors. Many functions will raise exceptions if they encounter issues (e.g., permission errors, file not found). Use the output from the environment to troubleshoot.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, perform exploratory calls with known inputs to validate the expected outcomes. This can help clarify ambiguities.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions depend on the state of the environment (e.g., files must exist before they can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls in a logical sequence to ensure that prerequisites are met.\n\n5. **Use Temporary Paths**: When testing file operations, use temporary directories (like `/tmp`) to avoid conflicts with existing files and to keep the environment clean.\n\n6. **Document Findings**: Keep track of any new insights or clarifications about function behaviors for future reference. This will help streamline the process for subsequent agents.\n\n7. **Environment State**: Be aware that the state of the environment can change with each function call. Always check the current state before making assumptions about what files or directories exist.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new file and write some content to it.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `lay_path('/tmp/new_file.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `write_next('/tmp/new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to append content to the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to confirm the content was written correctly.\n\n2. **User Query**: \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/tmp/new_file.txt')` to change the permissions.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `look_in('/tmp', all=True)` to verify the file's permissions if the function supports showing permissions.\n\n3. **User Query**: \"I want to move a file to a different location.\"\n   - **Step 1**: Ensure the file exists by calling `look_in('/tmp', all=True)`.\n   - **Step 2**: Call `move_it('/tmp/new_file.txt', '/tmp/another_directory/new_file.txt')` to move the file.\n   - **Step 3**: Call `look_in('/tmp/another_directory', all=True)` to confirm the file has been moved.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"Can you show me the content of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `view('/tmp/new_file.txt')` to display the content of the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
