File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Finally, we need to create a new file 'shared_backup.txt' with the contents of 'shared.txt'.\n\nHere are the function calls we'll need to make:\n\n<function_list>\nmod_perms(\"rwxrwxrwx\", \"shared.sys\")\nview(\"shared.txt\")\nwrite_over(\"shared_backup.txt\", \"\")\n</function_list>\n\nNow, let me explain the reasoning behind these function calls:\n\n1. `mod_perms(\"rwxrwxrwx\", \"shared.sys\")`: This will set the permissions of 'shared.sys' to the maximum (read, write, and execute for owner, group, and others).\n\n2. `view(\"shared.txt\")`: This will show us the contents of 'shared.txt', which we need to backup.\n\n3. `write_over(\"shared_backup.txt\", \"\")`: We use this to create the new backup file. We're initially creating it empty, and we'll fill it with the contents of 'shared.txt' after we see what those contents are.\n\nAfter these function calls are executed, we'll need to take the content from 'shared.txt' (which we'll see in the output of the `view()` function) and write it to 'shared_backup.txt'. We'll do that in the next step after we see the results of these function calls.",
   "The output from the environment reveals some issues and partial success. Let's analyze the results:\n\n1. The attempt to modify permissions of 'shared.sys' failed due to permission denial. This suggests we don't have the necessary privileges to change its permissions.\n\n2. We successfully viewed the contents of 'shared.txt', which contains two lines of text.\n\n3. We successfully created an empty 'shared_backup.txt' file.\n\nGiven these results, we need to adjust our approach. We can't modify 'shared.sys', but we can still complete the backup task. Let's proceed with writing the contents of 'shared.txt' to 'shared_backup.txt':\n\n<function_list>\nwrite_over(\"shared_backup.txt\", \"Shared information.\\nLine2.\\n\")\nview(\"shared_backup.txt\")\n</function_list>\n\nExplanation of these new function calls:\n\n1. `write_over(\"shared_backup.txt\", \"Shared information.\\nLine2.\\n\")`: This will write the contents we saw in 'shared.txt' to our backup file.\n\n2. `view(\"shared_backup.txt\")`: This will allow us to verify that the backup was created successfully with the correct content.\n\nAfter these function calls are executed, we should have completed the backup task despite not being able to modify the permissions of 'shared.sys'.",
   "Based on the output from the environment, we can see that:\n\n1. The `write_over()` function successfully wrote the content to 'shared_backup.txt' without any errors.\n2. The `view()` function shows that 'shared_backup.txt' now contains the exact content that was in 'shared.txt'.\n\nThis output indicates that we have successfully created a backup of 'shared.txt' in 'shared_backup.txt', which was the main goal of the user's query.\n\nAlthough we weren't able to modify the permissions of 'shared.sys' due to lack of privileges, we have accomplished the primary task of backing up the contents of 'shared.txt'.\n\nGiven that we have completed the main objective of the query, I believe this output satisfies the user's request.\n\n<end_query>"

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6.

Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
