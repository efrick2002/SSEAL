your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n   To interact with this environment, you should first analyze the provided functions and their descriptions. Then, based on the user query, you should decide which functions to call and in what order. You may need to call multiple functions to get the desired result. Be careful with the input formats and the return types of each function. Also, be aware of the potential error cases and handle them accordingly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n   Example 1: What is the favorite food of the user with ID '1'?\n   Step 1: Call f('1') to get the user information.\n   Step 2: Extract the favorite food ID from the user information.\n   Step 3: Call h(favorite_food_id) to get the food information.\n   Step 4: Return the food name.\n\n   Example 2: What is the weather at the location with ID '1'?\n   Step 1: Call g(1) to get the location information.\n   Step 2: Extract the location ID from the location information.\n   Step 3: Call q(location_id) to get the weather.\n   Step 4: Return the weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
