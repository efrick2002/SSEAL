Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to avoid confusion.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., querying a non-existent user ID). Always check the output for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n3. **Exploration Strategy**: When faced with ambiguity, start by querying broader functions (like `list_user_ids()` or `find_foods_by_name()`) to gather context before diving into more specific queries.\n\n4. **Data Relationships**: Understand the relationships between users, foods, and locations. For example, a user can have multiple favorite foods, and each food can have associated allergic ingredients.\n\n5. **Iterative Testing**: Use the outputs from one function to inform the inputs of another. For example, after retrieving a user's favorite foods, you can query for detailed information about each food.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Keep track of the functions you use and their outputs. This will help you build a mental model of the data structure and relationships in the environment.\n\n7. **Example Queries**: Use the examples provided below to guide your interactions with the environment.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to retrieve Alice's favorite food IDs.\n     - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_food_info(1)` to get details about the first favorite food (Pizza).\n     - Output: `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', 'calories': 285, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Gluten', 'Dairy']}`\n   - **Step 3**: Call `get_food_info(2)` to get details about the second favorite food (Chocolate).\n     - Output: `{'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate', 'calories': 50, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Milk', 'Soy']}`\n   - **Step 4**: Call `get_food_info(3)` to get details about the third favorite food (Sushi).\n     - Output: `{'id': 3, 'name': 'Sushi', 'calories': 300, 'allergic_ingredients': ['Fish', 'Soy']}`\n\n2. **User Query**: \"What is the current weather in Chicago?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_user_location(35)` to find Charlie's location ID.\n     - Output: `3`\n   - **Step 2**: Call `get_weather_at_location(3)` to get the current weather for Chicago.\n     - Output: `'Mostly Cloudy, Temperature: 60\u00b0F'`\n\n3. **User Query**: \"What are the allergic ingredients in Ice Cream?\"\n   - **Step 1**: Call `get_food_allergic_ingredients(5)` to retrieve the allergic ingredients for Ice Cream.\n     - Output: `['Dairy']`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
