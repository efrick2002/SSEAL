Can be 'file' or 'dir'.\n*   **Return Type:** None\n*   **Example Usage:**\n    <function_list>\nlay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='dir')\n</function_list>\n*   **Observed Error Cases:**\n    *   If the path already exists and the mode is 'dir', raises an exception.\n    *   If the mode is not 'file' or 'dir', raises an exception.\n*   **Notes:** This function uses the `mkdir` command to create a directory and the `touch` command to create a file.\n\n### mod_perms(mode, path)\nModifies the permissions of a file or directory.\n\n*   **Arguments:**\n    *   `mode` (str): The new permissions to set.\n    *   `path` (str): The path of the file or directory to modify.\n*   **Return Type:** None\n*   **Example Usage:**\n    <function_list>\nmod_perms('777', '/path/to/file')\n</function_list>\n*   **Observed Error Cases:**\n    *   If the mode is not 9 characters long, raises an AssertionError.\n*   **Notes:** This function uses the `chmod` command to modify the permissions.\n\n### move_it(src, dest)\nMoves a file or directory from the source to the destination.\n\n*   **Arguments:**\n    *   `src` (str): The path of the file or directory to move.\n    *   `dest` (str): The path where the file or directory will be moved.\n*   **Return Type:** None\n*   **Example Usage:**\n    <function_list>\nmove_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')\n</function_list>\n*   **Observed Error Cases:**\n    *   If the source does not exist, raises an exception.\n*   **Notes:** This function uses the `mv` command to move the file or directory.\n\n### view(*files)\nDisplays the contents of a file.\n\n*   **Arguments:**\n    *   `*files` (str): The path of the file to view.\n*   **Return Type:** str\n*   **Example Usage:**\n    <function_list>\nview('file.txt')\n</function_list>\n*   **Observed Error Cases:**\n    *   If the file does not exist, raises an exception.\n*   **Notes:** This function uses the `cat` command to display the file contents.\n\n\n        </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n**Operating the Environment:**\n\nTo interact with the environment, you can submit function calls in the `<function_list>` tags. The environment will respond with the output of the function call.\n\n**Tips for Future Agents:**\n\n*   Make sure to carefully read the function descriptors and argument types to understand what each function does and how to use it.\n*   Use the `<function_list>` tags to submit function calls and receive feedback from the environment.\n*   Pay attention to observed error cases and notes for each function to avoid common pitfalls.\n*   Use the examples provided to understand how to use each function in practice.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n\n*   Be careful when using the `mod_perms` function, as it requires a 9-character mode string.\n*   Be aware of the `move_it` function's behavior when moving files or directories.\n*   Use the `view` function to display file contents, but be aware of the potential for exceptions if the file does not exist.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Creating a new directory**\n\n*   User query: `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='dir')`\n*   Environment response: `mkdir: cannot create directory '/path/to/directory': File exists`\n*   Reasoning: The `lay_path` function is called with the `mode` argument set to `'dir'`, but the directory already exists.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying file permissions**\n\n*   User query: `mod_perms('777', '/path/to/file')`\n*   Environment response: `chmod: cannot access '/path/to/file': No such file or directory`\n*   Reasoning: The `mod_perms` function is called with a valid mode string, but the file does not exist.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a file**\n\n*   User query: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n*   Environment response: `mv: cannot stat '/path/to/source': No such file or directory`\n*   Reasoning: The `move_it` function is called with a source path that does not exist.\n\n**Example 4: Viewing a file**\n\n*   User query: `view('file.txt')`\n*   Environment response: `cat: file.txt: No such file or directory`\n*   Reasoning: The `view` function is called with a file path that does not exist.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Can be 'file' or 'dir'.\n*   **Return Type:** None\n*   **Example Usage:**\n    <function_list>\nlay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='dir')\n</function_list>\n*   **Observed Error Cases:**\n    *   If the path already exists and the mode is 'dir', raises an exception.\n    *   If the mode is not 'file' or 'dir', raises an exception.\n*   **Notes:** This function uses the `mkdir` command to create a directory and the `touch` command to create a file.\n\n### mod_perms(mode, path)\nModifies the permissions of a file or directory.\n\n*   **Arguments:**\n    *   `mode` (str): The new permissions to set.\n    *   `path` (str): The path of the file or directory to modify.\n*   **Return Type:** None\n*   **Example Usage:**\n    <function_list>\nmod_perms('777', '/path/to/file')\n</function_list>\n*   **Observed Error Cases:**\n    *   If the mode is not 9 characters long, raises an AssertionError.\n*   **Notes:** This function uses the `chmod` command to modify the permissions.\n\n### move_it(src, dest)\nMoves a file or directory from the source to the destination.\n\n*   **Arguments:**\n    *   `src` (str): The path of the file or directory to move.\n    *   `dest` (str): The path where the file or directory will be moved.\n*   **Return Type:** None\n*   **Example Usage:**\n    <function_list>\nmove_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')\n</function_list>\n*   **Observed Error Cases:**\n    *   If the source does not exist, raises an exception.\n*   **Notes:** This function uses the `mv` command to move the file or directory.\n\n### view(*files)\nDisplays the contents of a file.\n\n*   **Arguments:**\n    *   `*files` (str): The path of the file to view.\n*   **Return Type:** str\n*   **Example Usage:**\n    <function_list>\nview('file.txt')\n</function_list>\n*   **Observed Error Cases:**\n    *   If the file does not exist, raises an exception.\n*   **Notes:** This function uses the `cat` command to display the file contents.\n\n\n        </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n**Operating the Environment:**\n\nTo interact with the environment, you can submit function calls in the `<function_list>` tags. The environment will respond with the output of the function call.\n\n**Tips for Future Agents:**\n\n*   Make sure to carefully read the function descriptors and argument types to understand what each function does and how to use it.\n*   Use the `<function_list>` tags to submit function calls and receive feedback from the environment.\n*   Pay attention to observed error cases and notes for each function to avoid common pitfalls.\n*   Use the examples provided to understand how to use each function in practice.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n\n*   Be careful when using the `mod_perms` function, as it requires a 9-character mode string.\n*   Be aware of the `move_it` function's behavior when moving files or directories.\n*   Use the `view` function to display file contents, but be aware of the potential for exceptions if the file does not exist.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Creating a new directory**\n\n*   User query: `lay_path('/path/to/directory', mode='dir')`\n*   Environment response: `mkdir: cannot create directory '/path/to/directory': File exists`\n*   Reasoning: The `lay_path` function is called with the `mode` argument set to `'dir'`, but the directory already exists.\n\n**Example 2: Modifying file permissions**\n\n*   User query: `mod_perms('777', '/path/to/file')`\n*   Environment response: `chmod: cannot access '/path/to/file': No such file or directory`\n*   Reasoning: The `mod_perms` function is called with a valid mode string, but the file does not exist.\n\n**Example 3: Moving a file**\n\n*   User query: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n*   Environment response: `mv: cannot stat '/path/to/source': No such file or directory`\n*   Reasoning: The `move_it` function is called with a source path that does not exist.\n\n**Example 4: Viewing a file**\n\n*   User query: `view('file.txt')`\n*   Environment response: `cat: file.txt: No such file or directory`\n*   Reasoning: The `view` function is called with a file path that does not exist.\n\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
