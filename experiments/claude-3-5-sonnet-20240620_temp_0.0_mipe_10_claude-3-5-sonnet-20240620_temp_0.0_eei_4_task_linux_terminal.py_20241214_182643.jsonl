File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1.

Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1.

Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6.

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

   "To accomplish this task, we need to break it down into several steps. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. Create the 'alphabet_5' directory\n2.

We use `lay_path(\"alphabet_5\", mode=\"dir\")` to create the 'alphabet_5' directory.\n2. For each letter (a to e), we do two operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create the file (e.g., \"alphabet_5/a.txt\")\n   - Use `write_over()` to write the corresponding letter into the file\n3. After creating all files, we use `look_in(\"alphabet_5\")` to verify that all files have been created in the directory.\n4. Finally, we use `view()` with all five files as arguments to display the contents of each file, ensuring that each contains only its respective letter.\n\nThis sequence of operations should create the directory, add the files with their respective contents, and then verify the results.",
   "Based on the output from the environment, we can see that all the operations were successful:\n\n1. The 'alphabet_5' directory was created successfully.\n2. All five files (a.txt, b.txt, c.txt, d.txt, e.txt) were created inside the 'alphabet_5' directory.\n3. Each file was written with its corresponding letter.\n4. The `look_in(\"alphabet_5\")` command confirmed that all five files are present in the directory.\n5. The `view()` command showed that each file contains only its respective letter.\n\nThis output satisfies the user's query to create a directory named 'alphabet_5' containing five files named a.txt, b.txt, c.txt, d.txt, and e.txt, each containing only the letter corresponding to its filename.\n\nTherefore, I believe the task is complete and no further function calls are necessary.\n\n<end_query>"

Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6.

Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1.

Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1.

Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

After creating all files, we use `look_in(\"alphabet_5\")` to verify that all files have been created in the directory.\n4.

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

   "To delete the directory 'tempdir', we need to use the `destory()` function. However, we should first check if the directory exists and if it's empty. If it's not empty, we'll need to use the recursive option. Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1. First, we'll check if 'tempdir' exists and what it contains.\n2.

If it doesn't exist, we'll get an error message.\n2. `destory(\"tempdir\", recursive=True)`: This will delete 'tempdir' and all its contents. We use the recursive option to ensure it deletes everything inside the directory if it's not empty.\n3. `look_in(\".\")`: This will show us the contents of the current directory after the deletion, allowing us to verify that 'tempdir' has been removed.\n\nAfter executing these functions, we'll be able to confirm whether 'tempdir' has been successfully deleted.",

We use the `all=True` parameter to ensure we see everything.\n2. `look_in(\"tempdir\")`: If 'tempdir' has been successfully deleted, this should return an error indicating that the directory doesn't exist.\n\nThese calls will help us confirm whether 'tempdir' has been successfully deleted or if it still exists.",

This confirms that 'tempdir' no longer exists as a directory.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the original query to delete the 'tempdir' directory has been successfully completed.

File System Operations:\n   - Use `lay_path()` to create files and directories.\n   - Use `look_in()` to list directory contents.\n   - Use `destory()` to remove files and directories.\n   - Use `move_it()` to move or rename files and directories.\n\n2. File Content Operations:\n   - Use `view()` to read file contents.\n   - Use `write_over()` to create or overwrite files.\n   - Use `write_next()` to append to files.\n\n3. Permission Management:\n   - Use `mod_perms()` to change file permissions.\n\n4. Environment Variables:\n   - Use `export_env()` to set environment variables.\n   - Access environment variables in `callback()` using \"$VAR_NAME\" syntax.\n\n5. Command History:\n   - Use `look_back()` to view command history.\n\n6. Pattern Matching:\n   - Use `match_it()` for pattern matching, though its behavior is unclear.\n\n7. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions raise exceptions for invalid operations.\n   - Always check for exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n\n8. Function Exploration:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, test it with various inputs and observe the results.\n   - Use `look_in()` frequently to verify the effects of file system operations.\n\n9. Limitations:\n   - The environment seems to simulate a Unix-like file system, but with some limitations.\n   - Some operations that would normally require elevated permissions (like `super()`) may not work as expected.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the query to determine which functions are needed.\n2. Break down the task into a series of function calls.\n3. Execute the functions step by step, checking the output of each call.\n4. Use `look_in()` and `view()` to verify the results of operations.\n5. If an operation fails, try to understand why and adjust your approach.\n6. Provide a clear explanation of each step to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file, write content to it, and display the content.\n\nUser Query: \"Create a file named 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then show me what's in the file.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Create the file:\n   lay_path(\"example.txt\")\n\n2. Write content to the file:\n   write_over(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"example.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We first create the file using `lay_path()`, then use `write_over()` to add content to it. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents.\n\nExample 2: List files in the current directory, create a new directory, move a file into it, and show the new directory structure.\n\nUser Query: \"Show me the files in the current directory, create a folder named 'docs', move 'example.txt' into it, and show me the new directory structure.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. List current directory contents:\n   look_in(\".\")\n\n2. Create new directory:\n   lay_path(\"docs\", mode=\"dir\")\n\n3. Move the file:\n   move_it(\"example.txt\", \"docs/example.txt\")\n\n4. Show new directory structure:\n   look_in(\".\")\n   look_in(\"docs\")\n\nExplanation: We start by using `look_in()` to show the current directory contents. Then we create a new directory with `lay_path()`, move the file using `move_it()`, and finally use `look_in()` twice to show the new structure of both the current directory and the new 'docs' directory.\n\nExample 3: Set an environment variable and use it in a file.\n\nUser Query: \"Set an environment variable named 'GREETING' with the value 'Hello from the environment!', then create a file that includes this greeting.\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. Set the environment variable:\n   export_env(\"GREETING\", \"Hello from the environment!\")\n\n2. Create a file using the environment variable:\n   lay_path(\"greeting.txt\")\n   write_over(\"greeting.txt\", \"The greeting is: $GREETING\")\n\n3. Display the file content:\n   view(\"greeting.txt\")\n\nExplanation: We use `export_env()` to set the environment variable. Then we create a new file with `lay_path()` and write to it using `write_over()`, incorporating the environment variable in the content. Finally, we use `view()` to display the file's contents, which should show the expanded environment variable.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

If it doesn't exist, we'll get an error message.\n2. `destory(\"tempdir\", recursive=True)`: This will delete 'tempdir' and all its contents. We use the recursive option to ensure it deletes everything inside the directory if it's not empty.\n3. `look_in(\".\")`: This will show us the contents of the current directory after the deletion, allowing us to verify that 'tempdir' has been removed.\n\nAfter executing these functions, we'll be able to confirm whether 'tempdir' has been successfully deleted."
