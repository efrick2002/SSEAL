Also, be aware of the observed error cases and handle them accordingly.\n\nSome general tips:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the contents of a directory before attempting to access or modify files.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory before attempting to access or modify it.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories, but be aware that it will overwrite the destination if it already exists.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write to files, but be aware that they will overwrite the file if it already exists.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate this environment with ease.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Creating a new file and writing to it\n\n* Call `lay_path('/path/to/new/file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n* Call `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to write to the new file.\n\nExample 2: Searching for files matching a pattern\n\n* Call `match_it('*.txt', 'file1.txt', 'file2.txt')` to search for files matching the pattern `*.txt`.\n\nExample 3: Moving a file to a new location\n\n* Call `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file to a new location.\n\nExample 4: Modifying the permissions of a file\n\n* Call `mod_perms('rwxrwxrwx', '/path/to/file')` to modify the permissions of the file.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions provided to perform various tasks in this environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
