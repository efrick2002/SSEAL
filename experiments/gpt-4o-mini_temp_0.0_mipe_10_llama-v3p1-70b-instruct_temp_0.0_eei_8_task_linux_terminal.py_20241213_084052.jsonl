Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Each function has its own specific arguments and return types, so make sure to check the documentation for each function before using it.\n\nWhen submitting functions to the environment, make sure to use the correct syntax and provide the required arguments. The environment will return the result of the function call, which can be used to determine the outcome of the action.\n\nSome tips for using this environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list files and directories in a directory.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to modify the permissions of a file or directory.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move a file or directory.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of files.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to files.\n\nBy following these tips and using the functions provided, you should be able to effectively interact with this environment and perform various tasks.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Listing files in a directory\n\n* User query: \"List all files in the current directory.\"\n* Function call: `look_in('.', all=True, show_perm=True)`\n* Environment response: `rw-r--r-- file.txt\\nrwxr-xr-x path`\n\nExample 2: Modifying file permissions\n\n* User query: \"Change the permissions of file.txt to read-only.\"\n* Function call: `mod_perms('r--r--r--', 'file.txt')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 3: Moving a file\n\n* User query: \"Move file.txt to the /path/to/destination directory.\"\n* Function call: `move_it('file.txt', '/path/to/destination')`\n* Environment response: None\n\nExample 4: Viewing file contents\n\n* User query: \"View the contents of file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `view('file.txt')`\n* Environment response: `contents of file.txt`\n\nExample 5: Writing to a file\n\n* User query: \"Write 'Hello, World!' to file.txt.\"\n* Function call: `write_next('file.txt', 'Hello, World!')`\n* Environment response: None\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
