File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7.

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7.

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3.

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File System Operations:\n   - The environment simulates a file system, but with limitations.\n   - You cannot create nested directories in a single operation.\n   - Always check if a directory exists before trying to create files within it or move files into it.\n\n2. Function Behavior:\n   - Always check the return values and handle potential exceptions.\n   - Some functions (like super()) have unclear purposes and may not be useful.\n   - The match_it() function behaves like grep but may have limitations with complex regex patterns.\n\n3. Permissions:\n   - Use mod_perms() to change file permissions, but always use a 9-character string.\n   - The look_in() function can show permissions when the show_perm flag is set to True.\n\n4. File Content:\n   - Use view() to check file contents after write operations.\n   - write_next() appends without adding a newline, so manage newlines in your content if needed.\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions for invalid operations. Always be prepared to catch and handle these.\n\n6. Exploration Strategy:\n   - When unsure about a function's behavior, start with simple inputs and gradually test more complex scenarios.\n   - Use look_in() and view() frequently to verify the results of your operations.\n\n7. Command History:\n   - The look_back() function can be useful for debugging or understanding the sequence of operations.\n\nTo answer user queries:\n1. Break down the query into individual file system operations.\n2. Use appropriate functions to perform each operation, checking for success and handling errors.\n3. Use look_in() and view() to gather information about the file system state and file contents.\n4. Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Combine the results of your operations to formulate a response to the user's query.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a file called 'hello.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', then rename it to 'greeting.txt'.\"\n\nStep 1: Create the file with content\nwrite_over(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nStep 2: Verify the file was created and has the correct content\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the file appears in the directory listing\nview(\"hello.txt\")  # Verify the content\n\nStep 3: Rename the file\nmove_it(\"hello.txt\", \"greeting.txt\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the rename operation\nlook_in(\".\")  # Check if the new filename appears and the old one is gone\nview(\"greeting.txt\")  # Verify the content is preserved\n\nExample 2: \"List all files in the current directory that start with 'test' and have read and write permissions for the owner.\"\n\nStep 1: Get the list of all files with permissions\nfiles_with_perms = look_in(\".\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n\nStep 2: Use match_it to find files starting with 'test'\ntest_files = match_it(\"^test\", *files_with_perms.split('\\n'))\n\nStep 3: Filter the results to only include files with read and write permissions for the owner\nrw_files = [file for file in test_files.split('\\n') if file.startswith('rw')]\n\nStep 4: Extract just the filenames from the filtered list\nresult = [file.split()[-1] for file in rw_files]\n\nThe final result would be the list of filenames meeting the criteria.\n\nExample 3: \"Append the current date to a log file named 'activity.log', but create the file if it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStep 1: Check if the file exists\nfile_list = look_in(\".\")\nif \"activity.log\" not in file_list:\n    lay_path(\"activity.log\")\n\nStep 2: Get the current date (assume we have a function get_current_date())\ncurrent_date = get_current_date()\n\nStep 3: Append the date to the file\nwrite_next(\"activity.log\", f\"\\n{current_date}\")\n\nStep 4: Verify the operation\nview(\"activity.log\")\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down user queries into a series of function calls, how to verify operations, and how to combine multiple functions to achieve the desired result.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
