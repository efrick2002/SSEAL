    </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

    </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

    </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

    </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

    </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

    </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

    </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

    </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

    </functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, it is essential to understand the behavior of each function. The functions can be broadly categorized into three groups: user information, location information, and food information.\n\nThe user information functions (b, f, j, m, n, v) return information about a specific user, but only if the input is 1. If the input is not 1, they raise an exception.\n\nThe location information functions (e, g, q, r, w) return information about a specific location, but only if the input is between 1 and 5. If the input is not between 1 and 5, they raise an exception.\n\nThe food information functions (h, t, u, y) return information about a specific food.\n\nThe function x returns a list of dictionaries containing city information, regardless of the input.\n\nTo answer user queries, it is necessary to call the relevant functions in the correct order, using the output of one function as the input to another. For example, to get the current weather for a specific location, you would call function g with the location ID as the input.\n\nIt is also important to note that some functions may raise exceptions if the input is not valid. In such cases, it is necessary to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the current weather for a specific location.\n\n1. Call function g with the location ID as the input: g(1)\n2. The function returns a dictionary containing the location information, including the current weather.\n\nExample 2: Get the food name for a specific food ID.\n\n1. Call function t with the food ID as the input: t(1)\n2. The function returns the food name as a string.\n\nExample 3: Get the user email for a specific user ID.\n\n1. Call function v with the user ID as the input: v(1)\n2. The function returns the user email as a string.\n\nExample 4: Get the list of cities.\n\n1. Call function x with any iterable as the input: x([1, 2, 3])\n2. The function returns a list of dictionaries containing city information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
