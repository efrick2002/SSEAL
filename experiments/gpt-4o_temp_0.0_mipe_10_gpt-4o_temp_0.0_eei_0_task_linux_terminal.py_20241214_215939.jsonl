Use `lay_path('logs/access.log', mode='file')` to create the 'access.log' file.\n3. Use `lay_path('logs/error.log', mode='file')` to create the 'error.log' file.\n4. Use `write_next('logs/error.log', '404 not found\\n')` to append '404 not found' and a newline to 'error.log'.\n5. Use `view('logs/error.log')` to read the contents of 'error.log'.\n6.
