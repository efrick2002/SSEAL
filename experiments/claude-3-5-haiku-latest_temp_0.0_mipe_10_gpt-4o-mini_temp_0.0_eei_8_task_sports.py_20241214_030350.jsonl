This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Use the actual DataFrame variables (player_df, teams_df) instead of string names\n2. Add the 'df' parameter to select, sort, and limit functions\n3. Ensure we're using the result of the merge_tables operation\n\nIf this doesn't work, I'll try a more direct approach:\n\n<function_list>\nplayer_df = read_db('player.tbl')\nteams_df = read_db('teams.tbl')\nresult = merge_tables(player_df, teams_df, on='team_id')\nselect(result, columns=['name', 'team_name'])\nsort(result, 'name')\nlimit(result, 10)\n</function_list>\n\nThis approach:\n1. Explicitly reads the tables into DataFrames\n2. Merges the tables\n3. Selects name and team name columns\n4. Sorts by name\n5. Limits to first 10 rows\n\nI'll try this method to see if it resolves the previous error.",
   "I see the issue now. The environment doesn't support direct variable assignment.

This approach:\n1. Reads the player table\n2. Reads the teams table\n3. Merges the tables on 'team_id'\n4. Selects name and team_name columns\n5. Sorts by name\n6. Limits to first 10 rows\n\nI'll try a simpler approach to just read the tables and see what happens:\n\n<function_list>\nread_db('player.tbl')\nread_db('teams.tbl')\n</function_list>\n\nThis will help me understand how the tables are being read and what DataFrames are created."

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

I'll use the `execute_operations()` function to chain the operations:\n\n<function_list>\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'coach.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'df': '$PREVIOUS', 'columns': ['name', 'team_id', 'years_experience'], 'conditions': {'years_experience': ('>', 15)}}}\n])\n</function_list>\n\nI've made these key changes:\n1. Used `execute_operations()` to chain the functions\n2. Used the first operation's result as input for the second operation by using '$PREVIOUS'\n3. Specified the full argument list for each operation\n4. Corrected the column names based on the previous error messages\n\nThis approach should:\n- Read the coach.tbl database\n- Select coaches with more than 15 years of experience\n- Return the name, team_id, and years_experience for those coaches\n\nIf this doesn't work, I'll try to get more information about the table structure first:\n\n<function_list>\nget_metadata()\n</function_list>\n\nThis will help me understand the exact table structure and column names if the previous attempt fails.",

Confirmed the column name is 'years_of_experience' from the metadata\n2. Separated the `read_db()` and `select()` operations\n3.

This will help you avoid `KeyError` when trying to read a table.\n\n2. **Reading Tables**: Use the `read_db(name)` function with the correct table name obtained from `ls()`. Ensure that the name matches exactly, including any file extensions.\n\n3. **DataFrame References**: When performing operations on DataFrames, ensure that the DataFrame variable is defined and correctly referenced. If you encounter a `NameError`, it likely means the DataFrame has not been defined in the current context.\n\n4. **Function Usage**: Each function has specific arguments and expected return types. Refer to the updated function documentation for details on how to use each function correctly.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle `KeyError` and `NameError` exceptions. These are common when referencing tables or DataFrames that do not exist or have not been defined.\n\n6. **Chaining Operations**: You can chain multiple operations together by reading a DataFrame and then immediately performing operations on it. For example, read a table, then aggregate or calculate a new column based on that DataFrame.\n\n7. **Testing and Validation**: If unsure about the output of a function, test it with known inputs and validate the results. This will help you understand the behavior of the functions better.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
