Data Discovery\n- Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering and column selection\n- Merge tables using merge_tables() when exploring relationships\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Calculate new columns carefully, avoiding complex logic\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- execute_operations() allows multi-step transformations\n- Keep operations simple and linear\n- Avoid deeply nested or complex calculations\n\n5. Common Pitfalls\n- No support for SQL-like subqueries\n- Limited conditional logic in column calculations\n- Be cautious with complex nested operations\n- Always validate intermediate results\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Discover available data\nb) Load relevant tables\nc) Explore and filter data\nd) Perform calculations\ne) Aggregate and summarize\nf) Visualize or further analyze results\n\nDebugging Tips:\n- Start with simple operations\n- Incrementally add complexity\n- Check error messages for specific limitations\n- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players who score more than 110 points per game\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Load player and team stats\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Filter and limit results\ntop_performers = limit(\n    select(\n        merged_data, \n        conditions={\n            'points_per_game': ('>', 110),\n            'salary': ('>', 35000000)\n        }\n    ), \n    n=3\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Calculate the average salary and performance for each position, considering team wins\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Aggregate by position and wins\nposition_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data,\n    group_by=['position', 'wins'], \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max'],\n        'points_per_game': ['max', 'min'],\n        'assists_per_game': ['mean']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 3: Coach Experience Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find experienced coaches with moderate salaries\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\nexperienced_coaches = select(\n    read_db('coach.tbl'), \n    conditions={\n        'years_experience': ('>', 7),\n        'salary': ('>', 4000000),\n        'salary': ('<', 7000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to:\n- Discover and load data\n- Merge tables\n- Apply filters\n- Perform aggregations\n- Extract meaningful insights\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Discovery\n- Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering and column selection\n- Merge tables using merge_tables() when exploring relationships\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Calculate new columns carefully, avoiding complex logic\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- execute_operations() allows multi-step transformations\n- Keep operations simple and linear\n- Avoid deeply nested or complex calculations\n\n5. Common Pitfalls\n- No support for SQL-like subqueries\n- Limited conditional logic in column calculations\n- Be cautious with complex nested operations\n- Always validate intermediate results\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Discover available data\nb) Load relevant tables\nc) Explore and filter data\nd) Perform calculations\ne) Aggregate and summarize\nf) Visualize or further analyze results\n\nDebugging Tips:\n- Start with simple operations\n- Incrementally add complexity\n- Check error messages for specific limitations\n- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players who score more than 110 points per game\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Load player and team stats\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Filter and limit results\ntop_performers = limit(\n    select(\n        merged_data, \n        conditions={\n            'points_per_game': ('>', 110),\n            'salary': ('>', 35000000)\n        }\n    ), \n    n=3\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Calculate the average salary and performance for each position, considering team wins\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Aggregate by position and wins\nposition_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data,\n    group_by=['position', 'wins'], \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max'],\n        'points_per_game': ['max', 'min'],\n        'assists_per_game': ['mean']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 3: Coach Experience Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find experienced coaches with moderate salaries\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\nexperienced_coaches = select(\n    read_db('coach.tbl'), \n    conditions={\n        'years_experience': ('>', 7),\n        'salary': ('>', 4000000),\n        'salary': ('<', 7000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to:\n- Discover and load data\n- Merge tables\n- Apply filters\n- Perform aggregations\n- Extract meaningful insights\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Discovery\n- Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering and column selection\n- Merge tables using merge_tables() when exploring relationships\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Calculate new columns carefully, avoiding complex logic\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- execute_operations() allows multi-step transformations\n- Keep operations simple and linear\n- Avoid deeply nested or complex calculations\n\n5. Common Pitfalls\n- No support for SQL-like subqueries\n- Limited conditional logic in column calculations\n- Be cautious with complex nested operations\n- Always validate intermediate results\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Discover available data\nb) Load relevant tables\nc) Explore and filter data\nd) Perform calculations\ne) Aggregate and summarize\nf) Visualize or further analyze results\n\nDebugging Tips:\n- Start with simple operations\n- Incrementally add complexity\n- Check error messages for specific limitations\n- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players who score more than 110 points per game\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Load player and team stats\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Filter and limit results\ntop_performers = limit(\n    select(\n        merged_data, \n        conditions={\n            'points_per_game': ('>', 110),\n            'salary': ('>', 35000000)\n        }\n    ), \n    n=3\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Calculate the average salary and performance for each position, considering team wins\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Aggregate by position and wins\nposition_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data,\n    group_by=['position', 'wins'], \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max'],\n        'points_per_game': ['max', 'min'],\n        'assists_per_game': ['mean']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 3: Coach Experience Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find experienced coaches with moderate salaries\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\nexperienced_coaches = select(\n    read_db('coach.tbl'), \n    conditions={\n        'years_experience': ('>', 7),\n        'salary': ('>', 4000000),\n        'salary': ('<', 7000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to:\n- Discover and load data\n- Merge tables\n- Apply filters\n- Perform aggregations\n- Extract meaningful insights\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Discovery\n- Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering and column selection\n- Merge tables using merge_tables() when exploring relationships\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Calculate new columns carefully, avoiding complex logic\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- execute_operations() allows multi-step transformations\n- Keep operations simple and linear\n- Avoid deeply nested or complex calculations\n\n5. Common Pitfalls\n- No support for SQL-like subqueries\n- Limited conditional logic in column calculations\n- Be cautious with complex nested operations\n- Always validate intermediate results\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Discover available data\nb) Load relevant tables\nc) Explore and filter data\nd) Perform calculations\ne) Aggregate and summarize\nf) Visualize or further analyze results\n\nDebugging Tips:\n- Start with simple operations\n- Incrementally add complexity\n- Check error messages for specific limitations\n- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players who score more than 110 points per game\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1.

Load player and team stats\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Filter and limit results\ntop_performers = limit(\n    select(\n        merged_data, \n        conditions={\n            'points_per_game': ('>', 110),\n            'salary': ('>', 35000000)\n        }\n    ), \n    n=3\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Calculate the average salary and performance for each position, considering team wins\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Aggregate by position and wins\nposition_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data,\n    group_by=['position', 'wins'], \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max'],\n        'points_per_game': ['max', 'min'],\n        'assists_per_game': ['mean']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 3: Coach Experience Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find experienced coaches with moderate salaries\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\nexperienced_coaches = select(\n    read_db('coach.tbl'), \n    conditions={\n        'years_experience': ('>', 7),\n        'salary': ('>', 4000000),\n        'salary': ('<', 7000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to:\n- Discover and load data\n- Merge tables\n- Apply filters\n- Perform aggregations\n- Extract meaningful insights\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Discovery\n- Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering and column selection\n- Merge tables using merge_tables() when exploring relationships\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Calculate new columns carefully, avoiding complex logic\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- execute_operations() allows multi-step transformations\n- Keep operations simple and linear\n- Avoid deeply nested or complex calculations\n\n5. Common Pitfalls\n- No support for SQL-like subqueries\n- Limited conditional logic in column calculations\n- Be cautious with complex nested operations\n- Always validate intermediate results\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Discover available data\nb) Load relevant tables\nc) Explore and filter data\nd) Perform calculations\ne) Aggregate and summarize\nf) Visualize or further analyze results\n\nDebugging Tips:\n- Start with simple operations\n- Incrementally add complexity\n- Check error messages for specific limitations\n- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players who score more than 110 points per game\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Load player and team stats\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Filter and limit results\ntop_performers = limit(\n    select(\n        merged_data, \n        conditions={\n            'points_per_game': ('>', 110),\n            'salary': ('>', 35000000)\n        }\n    ), \n    n=3\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Calculate the average salary and performance for each position, considering team wins\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Aggregate by position and wins\nposition_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data,\n    group_by=['position', 'wins'], \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max'],\n        'points_per_game': ['max', 'min'],\n        'assists_per_game': ['mean']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 3: Coach Experience Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find experienced coaches with moderate salaries\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\nexperienced_coaches = select(\n    read_db('coach.tbl'), \n    conditions={\n        'years_experience': ('>', 7),\n        'salary': ('>', 4000000),\n        'salary': ('<', 7000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to:\n- Discover and load data\n- Merge tables\n- Apply filters\n- Perform aggregations\n- Extract meaningful insights\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Data Discovery\n- Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n- Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n\n2. Data Retrieval\n- Use read_db() to load specific tables\n- Verify table contents before further operations\n\n3. Data Manipulation Strategies\n- Use select() for filtering and column selection\n- Merge tables using merge_tables() when exploring relationships\n- Use aggregate() for statistical summaries\n- Calculate new columns carefully, avoiding complex logic\n\n4. Chaining Operations\n- execute_operations() allows multi-step transformations\n- Keep operations simple and linear\n- Avoid deeply nested or complex calculations\n\n5. Common Pitfalls\n- No support for SQL-like subqueries\n- Limited conditional logic in column calculations\n- Be cautious with complex nested operations\n- Always validate intermediate results\n\n6. Recommended Workflow\na) Discover available data\nb) Load relevant tables\nc) Explore and filter data\nd) Perform calculations\ne) Aggregate and summarize\nf) Visualize or further analyze results\n\nDebugging Tips:\n- Start with simple operations\n- Incrementally add complexity\n- Check error messages for specific limitations\n- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players who score more than 110 points per game\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1.

Load player and team stats\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Filter and limit results\ntop_performers = limit(\n    select(\n        merged_data, \n        conditions={\n            'points_per_game': ('>', 110),\n            'salary': ('>', 35000000)\n        }\n    ), \n    n=3\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Calculate the average salary and performance for each position, considering team wins\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Aggregate by position and wins\nposition_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data,\n    group_by=['position', 'wins'], \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max'],\n        'points_per_game': ['max', 'min'],\n        'assists_per_game': ['mean']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 3: Coach Experience Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find experienced coaches with moderate salaries\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\nexperienced_coaches = select(\n    read_db('coach.tbl'), \n    conditions={\n        'years_experience': ('>', 7),\n        'salary': ('>', 4000000),\n        'salary': ('<', 7000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to:\n- Discover and load data\n- Merge tables\n- Apply filters\n- Perform aggregations\n- Extract meaningful insights\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Recommended Workflow\na) Discover available data\nb) Load relevant tables\nc) Explore and filter data\nd) Perform calculations\ne) Aggregate and summarize\nf) Visualize or further analyze results\n\nDebugging Tips:\n- Start with simple operations\n- Incrementally add complexity\n- Check error messages for specific limitations\n- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players who score more than 110 points per game\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Load player and team stats\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Filter and limit results\ntop_performers = limit(\n    select(\n        merged_data, \n        conditions={\n            'points_per_game': ('>', 110),\n            'salary': ('>', 35000000)\n        }\n    ), \n    n=3\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Calculate the average salary and performance for each position, considering team wins\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Aggregate by position and wins\nposition_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data,\n    group_by=['position', 'wins'], \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max'],\n        'points_per_game': ['max', 'min'],\n        'assists_per_game': ['mean']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 3: Coach Experience Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find experienced coaches with moderate salaries\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\nexperienced_coaches = select(\n    read_db('coach.tbl'), \n    conditions={\n        'years_experience': ('>', 7),\n        'salary': ('>', 4000000),\n        'salary': ('<', 7000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to:\n- Discover and load data\n- Merge tables\n- Apply filters\n- Perform aggregations\n- Extract meaningful insights\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Load player and team stats\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Filter and limit results\ntop_performers = limit(\n    select(\n        merged_data, \n        conditions={\n            'points_per_game': ('>', 110),\n            'salary': ('>', 35000000)\n        }\n    ), \n    n=3\n)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Calculate the average salary and performance for each position, considering team wins\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\n# Merge player and team stats\nmerged_data = merge_tables(\n    read_db('player.tbl'), \n    read_db('team_stats.tbl'), \n    on='team_id'\n)\n\n# Aggregate by position and wins\nposition_performance = aggregate(\n    merged_data,\n    group_by=['position', 'wins'], \n    agg_dict={\n        'salary': ['mean', 'max'],\n        'points_per_game': ['max', 'min'],\n        'assists_per_game': ['mean']\n    }\n)\n```\n\nExample 3: Coach Experience Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find experienced coaches with moderate salaries\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n```python\nexperienced_coaches = select(\n    read_db('coach.tbl'), \n    conditions={\n        'years_experience': ('>', 7),\n        'salary': ('>', 4000000),\n        'salary': ('<', 7000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to:\n- Discover and load data\n- Merge tables\n- Apply filters\n- Perform aggregations\n- Extract meaningful insights\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Filter for coaches with over 15 years of experience\n5. Select the relevant columns\n\nHere's the function call sequence:\n\n<function_list>\nls()\nget_metadata()\nread_db('coach.tbl')\nread_db('teams.tbl')\nmerge_tables(read_db('coach.tbl'), read_db('teams.tbl'), on='team_id')\nselect(merge_tables(read_db('coach.tbl'), read_db('teams.tbl'), on='team_id'), \n       columns=['name', 'team_name', 'years_experience'], \n       conditions={'years_experience': ('>', 15)})\n</function_list>\n\nLet me explain my reasoning:\n- First, I'll use ls() to confirm available tables\n- get_metadata() will help understand table structures\n- I'll read both coach and teams tables\n- Merge them on team_id to connect coaches with their team names\n- Use select() to filter for coaches with over 15 years of experience\n- Select only the name, team name, and years of experience columns\n\nThis approach will give us a clear view of experienced coaches and their respective teams."

Erik Spoelstra (Heat) - 15 years of experience\n2. Steve Kerr (Warriors) - 9 years of experience\n3. Billy Donovan (Bulls) - 8 years of experience\n\nThis result seems to directly answer the query about finding experienced coaches. The data shows the coaches with 8 or more years of experience, sorted from most to least experienced.\n\n<end_query>"
