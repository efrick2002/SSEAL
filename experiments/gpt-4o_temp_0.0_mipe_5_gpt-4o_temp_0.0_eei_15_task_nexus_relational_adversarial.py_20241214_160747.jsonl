Functions generally require positive integer IDs to resolve specific entities like users, locations, or foods. Non-integer inputs, negative numbers, and zero are typically not resolvable.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs to understand their outputs.\n2. Use a variety of input types to determine the function's input constraints.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input expected.\n4. Use repeated calls with valid inputs to check for consistency in outputs.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, ensure they are enclosed within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will return outputs formatted as a list of dictionaries, which can be used to refine your understanding of each function's behavior.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Resolving a User's Favorite Foods**\n- **Query**: What are the favorite foods of user ID 1?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `m(1)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  2. For each food ID, call `t(food_id)` to get the food name.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  m(1)\n  t(1)\n  t(2)\n  t(3)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Start by resolving the user's favorite food IDs, then resolve each ID to a food name.\n\n**Example 2: Getting Weather Information for a Location**\n- **Query**: What is the current weather in New York?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `w(1)` to confirm the city name for location ID 1.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  w(1)\n  q(1)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use the location ID to first confirm the city, then retrieve the weather details.\n\n**Example 3: Listing All Available Foods**\n- **Query**: What foods are available in the system?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `c(\"\")` to get a list of all food items.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  c(\"\")\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use an empty string to retrieve all food items, as the function returns all items when no specific input is provided.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `m(1)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  2. For each food ID, call `t(food_id)` to get the food name.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  m(1)\n  t(1)\n  t(2)\n  t(3)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Start by resolving the user's favorite food IDs, then resolve each ID to a food name.\n\n**Example 2: Getting Weather Information for a Location**\n- **Query**: What is the current weather in New York?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `w(1)` to confirm the city name for location ID 1.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  w(1)\n  q(1)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use the location ID to first confirm the city, then retrieve the weather details.\n\n**Example 3: Listing All Available Foods**\n- **Query**: What foods are available in the system?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `c(\"\")` to get a list of all food items.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  c(\"\")\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use an empty string to retrieve all food items, as the function returns all items when no specific input is provided.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Functions generally require positive integer IDs to resolve specific entities like users, locations, or foods. Non-integer inputs, negative numbers, and zero are typically not resolvable.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs to understand their outputs.\n2. Use a variety of input types to determine the function's input constraints.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input expected.\n4. Use repeated calls with valid inputs to check for consistency in outputs.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, ensure they are enclosed within `<function_list>` tags.

Functions generally require positive integer IDs to resolve specific entities like users, locations, or foods. Non-integer inputs, negative numbers, and zero are typically not resolvable.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs to understand their outputs.\n2. Use a variety of input types to determine the function's input constraints.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input expected.\n4. Use repeated calls with valid inputs to check for consistency in outputs.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, ensure they are enclosed within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will return outputs formatted as a list of dictionaries, which can be used to refine your understanding of each function's behavior.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Resolving a User's Favorite Foods**\n- **Query**: What are the favorite foods of user ID 1?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `m(1)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  2. For each food ID, call `t(food_id)` to get the food name.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  m(1)\n  t(1)\n  t(2)\n  t(3)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Start by resolving the user's favorite food IDs, then resolve each ID to a food name.\n\n**Example 2: Getting Weather Information for a Location**\n- **Query**: What is the current weather in New York?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `w(1)` to confirm the city name for location ID 1.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  w(1)\n  q(1)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use the location ID to first confirm the city, then retrieve the weather details.\n\n**Example 3: Listing All Available Foods**\n- **Query**: What foods are available in the system?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `c(\"\")` to get a list of all food items.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  c(\"\")\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use an empty string to retrieve all food items, as the function returns all items when no specific input is provided.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Functions generally require positive integer IDs to resolve specific entities like users, locations, or foods. Non-integer inputs, negative numbers, and zero are typically not resolvable.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs to understand their outputs.\n2. Use a variety of input types to determine the function's input constraints.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input expected.\n4. Use repeated calls with valid inputs to check for consistency in outputs.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, ensure they are enclosed within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will return outputs formatted as a list of dictionaries, which can be used to refine your understanding of each function's behavior.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Resolving a User's Favorite Foods**\n- **Query**: What are the favorite foods of user ID 1?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `m(1)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  2. For each food ID, call `t(food_id)` to get the food name.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  m(1)\n  t(1)\n  t(2)\n  t(3)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Start by resolving the user's favorite food IDs, then resolve each ID to a food name.\n\n**Example 2: Getting Weather Information for a Location**\n- **Query**: What is the current weather in New York?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `w(1)` to confirm the city name for location ID 1.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  w(1)\n  q(1)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use the location ID to first confirm the city, then retrieve the weather details.\n\n**Example 3: Listing All Available Foods**\n- **Query**: What foods are available in the system?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `c(\"\")` to get a list of all food items.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  c(\"\")\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use an empty string to retrieve all food items, as the function returns all items when no specific input is provided.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Functions generally require positive integer IDs to resolve specific entities like users, locations, or foods. Non-integer inputs, negative numbers, and zero are typically not resolvable.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs to understand their outputs.\n2. Use a variety of input types to determine the function's input constraints.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input expected.\n4. Use repeated calls with valid inputs to check for consistency in outputs.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, ensure they are enclosed within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will return outputs formatted as a list of dictionaries, which can be used to refine your understanding of each function's behavior.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Resolving a User's Favorite Foods**\n- **Query**: What are the favorite foods of user ID 1?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `m(1)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  2. For each food ID, call `t(food_id)` to get the food name.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  m(1)\n  t(1)\n  t(2)\n  t(3)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Start by resolving the user's favorite food IDs, then resolve each ID to a food name.\n\n**Example 2: Getting Weather Information for a Location**\n- **Query**: What is the current weather in New York?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `w(1)` to confirm the city name for location ID 1.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  w(1)\n  q(1)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use the location ID to first confirm the city, then retrieve the weather details.\n\n**Example 3: Listing All Available Foods**\n- **Query**: What foods are available in the system?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `c(\"\")` to get a list of all food items.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  c(\"\")\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use an empty string to retrieve all food items, as the function returns all items when no specific input is provided.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Functions generally require positive integer IDs to resolve specific entities like users, locations, or foods. Non-integer inputs, negative numbers, and zero are typically not resolvable.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs to understand their outputs.\n2. Use a variety of input types to determine the function's input constraints.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input expected.\n4. Use repeated calls with valid inputs to check for consistency in outputs.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, ensure they are enclosed within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will return outputs formatted as a list of dictionaries, which can be used to refine your understanding of each function's behavior.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Resolving a User's Favorite Foods**\n- **Query**: What are the favorite foods of user ID 1?\n- **Process**:\n  1.

Call `c(\"\")` to get a list of all food items.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  c(\"\")\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use an empty string to retrieve all food items, as the function returns all items when no specific input is provided.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Functions generally require positive integer IDs to resolve specific entities like users, locations, or foods. Non-integer inputs, negative numbers, and zero are typically not resolvable.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs to understand their outputs.\n2. Use a variety of input types to determine the function's input constraints.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input expected.\n4. Use repeated calls with valid inputs to check for consistency in outputs.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, ensure they are enclosed within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will return outputs formatted as a list of dictionaries, which can be used to refine your understanding of each function's behavior.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Resolving a User's Favorite Foods**\n- **Query**: What are the favorite foods of user ID 1?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `m(1)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  2. For each food ID, call `t(food_id)` to get the food name.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  m(1)\n  t(1)\n  t(2)\n  t(3)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Start by resolving the user's favorite food IDs, then resolve each ID to a food name.\n\n**Example 2: Getting Weather Information for a Location**\n- **Query**: What is the current weather in New York?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `w(1)` to confirm the city name for location ID 1.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  w(1)\n  q(1)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use the location ID to first confirm the city, then retrieve the weather details.\n\n**Example 3: Listing All Available Foods**\n- **Query**: What foods are available in the system?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `c(\"\")` to get a list of all food items.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  c(\"\")\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use an empty string to retrieve all food items, as the function returns all items when no specific input is provided.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Functions generally require positive integer IDs to resolve specific entities like users, locations, or foods. Non-integer inputs, negative numbers, and zero are typically not resolvable.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs to understand their outputs.\n2. Use a variety of input types to determine the function's input constraints.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input expected.\n4. Use repeated calls with valid inputs to check for consistency in outputs.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, ensure they are enclosed within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will return outputs formatted as a list of dictionaries, which can be used to refine your understanding of each function's behavior.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Resolving a User's Favorite Foods**\n- **Query**: What are the favorite foods of user ID 1?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `m(1)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  2. For each food ID, call `t(food_id)` to get the food name.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  m(1)\n  t(1)\n  t(2)\n  t(3)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Start by resolving the user's favorite food IDs, then resolve each ID to a food name.\n\n**Example 2: Getting Weather Information for a Location**\n- **Query**: What is the current weather in New York?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `w(1)` to confirm the city name for location ID 1.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  w(1)\n  q(1)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use the location ID to first confirm the city, then retrieve the weather details.\n\n**Example 3: Listing All Available Foods**\n- **Query**: What foods are available in the system?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `c(\"\")` to get a list of all food items.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  c(\"\")\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use an empty string to retrieve all food items, as the function returns all items when no specific input is provided.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Functions generally require positive integer IDs to resolve specific entities like users, locations, or foods. Non-integer inputs, negative numbers, and zero are typically not resolvable.\n\nTo explore the environment effectively:\n1. Start by testing functions with known valid IDs to understand their outputs.\n2. Use a variety of input types to determine the function's input constraints.\n3. Pay attention to error messages, as they often indicate the type of input expected.\n4. Use repeated calls with valid inputs to check for consistency in outputs.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, ensure they are enclosed within `<function_list>` tags. The environment will return outputs formatted as a list of dictionaries, which can be used to refine your understanding of each function's behavior.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Resolving a User's Favorite Foods**\n- **Query**: What are the favorite foods of user ID 1?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `m(1)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  2. For each food ID, call `t(food_id)` to get the food name.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  m(1)\n  t(1)\n  t(2)\n  t(3)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Start by resolving the user's favorite food IDs, then resolve each ID to a food name.\n\n**Example 2: Getting Weather Information for a Location**\n- **Query**: What is the current weather in New York?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `w(1)` to confirm the city name for location ID 1.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the current weather information.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  w(1)\n  q(1)\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use the location ID to first confirm the city, then retrieve the weather details.\n\n**Example 3: Listing All Available Foods**\n- **Query**: What foods are available in the system?\n- **Process**:\n  1. Call `c(\"\")` to get a list of all food items.\n- **Function Calls**:\n  <function_list>\n  c(\"\")\n  </function_list>\n- **Reasoning**: Use an empty string to retrieve all food items, as the function returns all items when no specific input is provided.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
