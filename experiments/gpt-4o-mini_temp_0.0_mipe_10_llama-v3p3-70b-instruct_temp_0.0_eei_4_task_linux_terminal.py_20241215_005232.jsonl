The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The `look_back()` function can be used to view the history of previous commands, which can be helpful in debugging and understanding the environment's state.\n\nWhen using the `destory()` function, be cautious with the `recursive` and `force` parameters, as they can lead to unintended consequences. The `mod_perms()` function requires a valid mode string, and the `move_it()` function requires the source file to exist.\n\nThe `view()` function can be used to view the contents of files, but it will raise an error if the file does not exist. The `write_next()` and `write_over()` functions can be used to append or overwrite file contents, respectively.\n\nTo answer user queries, it's recommended to start by using the `look_in()` function to understand the environment's current state. Then, use the `view()` function to view the contents of relevant files. If necessary, use the `write_next()` or `write_over()` functions to modify file contents. Finally, use the `look_back()` function to verify the changes made.\n\nWhen submitting function calls, be sure to provide the correct argument types and formats. The environment will raise errors if the arguments are invalid or if the function is used incorrectly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write to it.\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')` to create a new file.\n2. Call `write_over('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')` to overwrite the file contents.\n3. Call `view('new_file.txt')` to verify the file contents.\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to move.\n2. Call `move_it('/path/to/existing_file', '/path/to/destination')` to move the file.\n3. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to verify the file has been moved.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\n1. Call `look_in('/', all=True, show_perm=True)` to find the file to search.\n2. Call `match_it('*.txt', 'existing_file.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n3. Call `view('existing_file.txt')` to verify the search results.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
