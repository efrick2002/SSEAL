Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Management:\n   - Always verify directory existence before operations\n   - Use look_in() to check directory contents\n   - Directories must be explicitly created before use\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with minimal, simple function calls\n   - Progressively explore edge cases\n   - Pay attention to error messages\n   - Maintain a systematic, incremental testing approach\n\n3. Common Pitfalls:\n   - Strict type checking (especially for callback)\n   - Complex path handling\n   - Specific, undocumented function mode requirements\n   - Dynamic system state\n\n4. Recommended Exploration Process:\n   - Begin with look_in() to understand current state\n   - Use look_back() to review previous interactions\n   - Test functions with minimal, valid inputs\n   - Gradually increase complexity of function calls\n   - Document and learn from each function's behavior\n\n5. Error Handling:\n   - Expect and catch potential exceptions\n   - Use try-except blocks when exploring unknown behaviors\n   - Log and analyze error messages for insights\n\n6. State Preservation:\n   - Some functions modify system state\n   - Be aware that previous calls might affect subsequent function behaviors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Scenario: File Management System\n\nUser Query: \"I want to create a new configuration file in the /tmp directory with some initial settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Check /tmp directory contents\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp', all=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Attempt to create directory (if needed)\n   ```\n   lay_path('/tmp/config', mode='file')\n   ```\n\n3. Write configuration content\n   ```\n   write_over('/tmp/config/settings.conf', 'DEBUG=true\\nLOG_LEVEL=info')\n   ```\n\n4. Verify file creation and content\n   ```\n   look_in('/tmp/config', all=True)\n   view('/tmp/config/settings.conf')\n   ```\n\nExample Scenario: Environment Variable Management\n\nUser Query: \"Set up a development environment with specific path and debug settings.\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Set development path\n   ```\n   export_env('DEV_PATH', '/project/development')\n   ```\n\n2. Enable debug mode\n   ```\n   export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n   ```\n\n3. Verify environment configuration\n   ```\n   look_back()\n   ```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic, incremental function usage to achieve specific goals within the environment's constraints.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
