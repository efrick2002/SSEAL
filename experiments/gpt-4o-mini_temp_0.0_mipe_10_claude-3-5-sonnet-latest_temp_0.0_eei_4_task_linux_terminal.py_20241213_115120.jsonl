File Operations:\n- write_next/write_over don't add automatic newlines\n- destory() requires explicit recursive flag for directories\n- move_it() can rename files or move between directories\n\n4. Environment Interaction:\n- look_back() helps track command history\n- look_in() provides different views based on flags\n- match_it() shows filename:line for matches\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently on success\n- Permission errors and missing files generate exceptions\n- Always verify operations with look_in() or view()\n\n6.

Permission Management:\n- Most file operations require elevated permissions via super()\n- Always call super() before destructive operations\n- File permissions use 9-character format (rwxrwxrwx)\n\n2. Path Handling:\n- Paths are Unix-style with forward slashes\n- lay_path() automatically creates parent directories\n- Relative paths are supported but use absolute paths for clarity\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next/write_over don't add automatic newlines\n- destory() requires explicit recursive flag for directories\n- move_it() can rename files or move between directories\n\n4. Environment Interaction:\n- look_back() helps track command history\n- look_in() provides different views based on flags\n- match_it() shows filename:line for matches\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently on success\n- Permission errors and missing files generate exceptions\n- Always verify operations with look_in() or view()\n\n6. Best Practices:\n- Create paths before operating on them\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Use super() before potentially dangerous operations\n- Test operations on small scale before large operations\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a protected configuration file with specific content\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nsuper()  # Ensure permissions\nlay_path(\"/etc/config.txt\")  # Create file\nwrite_over(\"/etc/config.txt\", \"key=value\\nmode=prod\")  # Write content\nmod_perms(\"rw-------\", \"/etc/config.txt\")  # Set restrictive permissions\nlook_in(\"/etc\", show_perm=True)  # Verify permissions\nview(\"/etc/config.txt\")  # Verify content\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Move all matching files to a backup directory\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nlay_path(\"/backup\", mode=\"dir\")  # Create backup directory\nwrite_over(\"/test/file1.txt\", \"content\")  # Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/test/file2.txt\", \"content\")\nmatch_it(\"content\", \"/test/*.txt\")  # Find matching files\nmove_it(\"/test/file1.txt\", \"/backup/file1.txt\")  # Move files\nmove_it(\"/test/file2.txt\", \"/backup/file2.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/backup\", all=True)  # Verify moves\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Set up a new environment with specific permissions\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nlay_path(\"/app/config\", mode=\"dir\")  # Create directory structure\nwrite_over(\"/app/config/settings.txt\", \"ENV=prod\")  # Create config\nexport_env(\"APP_HOME\", \"/app\")  # Set environment\nmod_perms(\"rwxr-xr--\", \"/app/config/settings.txt\")  # Set permissions\nlook_in(\"/app\", all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify setup\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Permission Management:\n- Most file operations require elevated permissions via super()\n- Always call super() before destructive operations\n- File permissions use 9-character format (rwxrwxrwx)\n\n2. Path Handling:\n- Paths are Unix-style with forward slashes\n- lay_path() automatically creates parent directories\n- Relative paths are supported but use absolute paths for clarity\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next/write_over don't add automatic newlines\n- destory() requires explicit recursive flag for directories\n- move_it() can rename files or move between directories\n\n4. Environment Interaction:\n- look_back() helps track command history\n- look_in() provides different views based on flags\n- match_it() shows filename:line for matches\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently on success\n- Permission errors and missing files generate exceptions\n- Always verify operations with look_in() or view()\n\n6. Best Practices:\n- Create paths before operating on them\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Use super() before potentially dangerous operations\n- Test operations on small scale before large operations\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a protected configuration file with specific content\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nsuper()  # Ensure permissions\nlay_path(\"/etc/config.txt\")  # Create file\nwrite_over(\"/etc/config.txt\", \"key=value\\nmode=prod\")  # Write content\nmod_perms(\"rw-------\", \"/etc/config.txt\")  # Set restrictive permissions\nlook_in(\"/etc\", show_perm=True)  # Verify permissions\nview(\"/etc/config.txt\")  # Verify content\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Move all matching files to a backup directory\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nlay_path(\"/backup\", mode=\"dir\")  # Create backup directory\nwrite_over(\"/test/file1.txt\", \"content\")  # Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/test/file2.txt\", \"content\")\nmatch_it(\"content\", \"/test/*.txt\")  # Find matching files\nmove_it(\"/test/file1.txt\", \"/backup/file1.txt\")  # Move files\nmove_it(\"/test/file2.txt\", \"/backup/file2.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/backup\", all=True)  # Verify moves\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Set up a new environment with specific permissions\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nlay_path(\"/app/config\", mode=\"dir\")  # Create directory structure\nwrite_over(\"/app/config/settings.txt\", \"ENV=prod\")  # Create config\nexport_env(\"APP_HOME\", \"/app\")  # Set environment\nmod_perms(\"rwxr-xr--\", \"/app/config/settings.txt\")  # Set permissions\nlook_in(\"/app\", all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify setup\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Permission Management:\n- Most file operations require elevated permissions via super()\n- Always call super() before destructive operations\n- File permissions use 9-character format (rwxrwxrwx)\n\n2. Path Handling:\n- Paths are Unix-style with forward slashes\n- lay_path() automatically creates parent directories\n- Relative paths are supported but use absolute paths for clarity\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next/write_over don't add automatic newlines\n- destory() requires explicit recursive flag for directories\n- move_it() can rename files or move between directories\n\n4. Environment Interaction:\n- look_back() helps track command history\n- look_in() provides different views based on flags\n- match_it() shows filename:line for matches\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently on success\n- Permission errors and missing files generate exceptions\n- Always verify operations with look_in() or view()\n\n6. Best Practices:\n- Create paths before operating on them\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Use super() before potentially dangerous operations\n- Test operations on small scale before large operations\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a protected configuration file with specific content\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nsuper()  # Ensure permissions\nlay_path(\"/etc/config.txt\")  # Create file\nwrite_over(\"/etc/config.txt\", \"key=value\\nmode=prod\")  # Write content\nmod_perms(\"rw-------\", \"/etc/config.txt\")  # Set restrictive permissions\nlook_in(\"/etc\", show_perm=True)  # Verify permissions\nview(\"/etc/config.txt\")  # Verify content\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Move all matching files to a backup directory\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nlay_path(\"/backup\", mode=\"dir\")  # Create backup directory\nwrite_over(\"/test/file1.txt\", \"content\")  # Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/test/file2.txt\", \"content\")\nmatch_it(\"content\", \"/test/*.txt\")  # Find matching files\nmove_it(\"/test/file1.txt\", \"/backup/file1.txt\")  # Move files\nmove_it(\"/test/file2.txt\", \"/backup/file2.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/backup\", all=True)  # Verify moves\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Set up a new environment with specific permissions\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nlay_path(\"/app/config\", mode=\"dir\")  # Create directory structure\nwrite_over(\"/app/config/settings.txt\", \"ENV=prod\")  # Create config\nexport_env(\"APP_HOME\", \"/app\")  # Set environment\nmod_perms(\"rwxr-xr--\", \"/app/config/settings.txt\")  # Set permissions\nlook_in(\"/app\", all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify setup\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Permission Management:\n- Most file operations require elevated permissions via super()\n- Always call super() before destructive operations\n- File permissions use 9-character format (rwxrwxrwx)\n\n2. Path Handling:\n- Paths are Unix-style with forward slashes\n- lay_path() automatically creates parent directories\n- Relative paths are supported but use absolute paths for clarity\n\n3. File Operations:\n- write_next/write_over don't add automatic newlines\n- destory() requires explicit recursive flag for directories\n- move_it() can rename files or move between directories\n\n4. Environment Interaction:\n- look_back() helps track command history\n- look_in() provides different views based on flags\n- match_it() shows filename:line for matches\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently on success\n- Permission errors and missing files generate exceptions\n- Always verify operations with look_in() or view()\n\n6. Best Practices:\n- Create paths before operating on them\n- Verify file contents after writes\n- Use super() before potentially dangerous operations\n- Test operations on small scale before large operations\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a protected configuration file with specific content\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nsuper()  # Ensure permissions\nlay_path(\"/etc/config.txt\")  # Create file\nwrite_over(\"/etc/config.txt\", \"key=value\\nmode=prod\")  # Write content\nmod_perms(\"rw-------\", \"/etc/config.txt\")  # Set restrictive permissions\nlook_in(\"/etc\", show_perm=True)  # Verify permissions\nview(\"/etc/config.txt\")  # Verify content\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Move all matching files to a backup directory\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nlay_path(\"/backup\", mode=\"dir\")  # Create backup directory\nwrite_over(\"/test/file1.txt\", \"content\")  # Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/test/file2.txt\", \"content\")\nmatch_it(\"content\", \"/test/*.txt\")  # Find matching files\nmove_it(\"/test/file1.txt\", \"/backup/file1.txt\")  # Move files\nmove_it(\"/test/file2.txt\", \"/backup/file2.txt\")\nlook_in(\"/backup\", all=True)  # Verify moves\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Set up a new environment with specific permissions\"\n```python\n# Sequence of operations:\nlay_path(\"/app/config\", mode=\"dir\")  # Create directory structure\nwrite_over(\"/app/config/settings.txt\", \"ENV=prod\")  # Create config\nexport_env(\"APP_HOME\", \"/app\")  # Set environment\nmod_perms(\"rwxr-xr--\", \"/app/config/settings.txt\")  # Set permissions\nlook_in(\"/app\", all=True, show_perm=True)  # Verify setup\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
