additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1.

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1.

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1.

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find Bob's user ID using k(): [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n   - Bob's ID is 21\n\n2. Get Bob's details using f(21):\n   - Favorite foods: [4, 5, 6]\n\n3. Get food details for each favorite food:\n   h(4) \u2192 Burger, 350 calories\n   h(5) \u2192 Ice Cream, 200 calories\n   h(6) \u2192 Pasta, 180 calories\n\nResult: Bob's favorite foods are Burger (350 cal), Ice Cream (200 cal), and Pasta (180 cal)\n\nExample 2: Find Allergenic Information for a Location's Typical Foods\n\nQuery: \"What are the common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5.

Find New York's location ID using w():\n   w(1) confirms New York\n\n2. Get user from New York using f(1):\n   - Favorite foods: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. Check allergenic ingredients:\n   u(1) \u2192 ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\n   u(2) \u2192 ['Milk', 'Soy']\n   u(3) \u2192 ['Fish', 'Soy']\n\nResult: Common allergenic ingredients in New York's typical foods include Gluten, Dairy, Milk, Soy, and Fish\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nEnvironment Interaction Guidelines:\n\n1. Function Call Mechanism:\n- Submit function calls within <function_list> tags\n- Each call should be a single function with appropriate arguments\n- Expect a list of dictionaries as return output\n\n2. ID Resolution:\n- Not all IDs are valid across all functions\n- Some functions return error messages for unresolvable IDs\n- Recommended to first verify ID validity using functions like f(), g(), h()\n\n3. Data Interconnectedness:\n- Functions are highly interconnected\n- User, location, and food IDs often relate to each other\n- Cross-reference information using multiple function calls\n\n4. Exploration Strategy:\n- Start with known valid IDs: [1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43]\n- Use k() to get the list of valid user IDs\n- Systematically explore function behaviors\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Many functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Always check return type before processing\n- Implement error checking in your query resolution process\n\n6. Consistent Data Retrieval:\n- Some functions (c, z) always return full lists\n- Location-based functions (e, g, q, r, w) provide consistent information\n- User and food functions offer rich, detailed information\n\nRecommended Query Resolution Process:\n1. Identify relevant functions\n2. Verify ID validity\n3. Make necessary function calls\n4. Aggregate and process results\n5. Handle potential errors\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find a User's Favorite Foods and Their Nutritional Information\n\nQuery: \"What are Bob's favorite foods and their calorie counts?\"\n\nResolution Steps:\n1.
