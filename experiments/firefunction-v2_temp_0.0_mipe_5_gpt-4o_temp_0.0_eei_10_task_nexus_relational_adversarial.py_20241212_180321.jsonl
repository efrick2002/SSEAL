The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2. Result: 'alice@gmail.com'\n\n**Example 2: Get Weather Information for a City**\n- User Query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify Burger's food ID using `t(4)`.\n  2. Call `y(4)` to get the calorie count for a Burger.\n  3. Result: 350\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions to answer specific queries by identifying the correct function and input based on the desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2. Result: 'alice@gmail.com'\n\n**Example 2: Get Weather Information for a City**\n- User Query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify Burger's food ID using `t(4)`.\n  2. Call `y(4)` to get the calorie count for a Burger.\n  3. Result: 350\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions to answer specific queries by identifying the correct function and input based on the desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2. Result: 'alice@gmail.com'\n\n**Example 2: Get Weather Information for a City**\n- User Query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify Burger's food ID using `t(4)`.\n  2. Call `y(4)` to get the calorie count for a Burger.\n  3. Result: 350\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions to answer specific queries by identifying the correct function and input based on the desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2. Result: 'alice@gmail.com'\n\n**Example 2: Get Weather Information for a City**\n- User Query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify Burger's food ID using `t(4)`.\n  2. Call `y(4)` to get the calorie count for a Burger.\n  3. Result: 350\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions to answer specific queries by identifying the correct function and input based on the desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2.

Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1.

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2. Result: 'alice@gmail.com'\n\n**Example 2: Get Weather Information for a City**\n- User Query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify Burger's food ID using `t(4)`.\n  2. Call `y(4)` to get the calorie count for a Burger.\n  3. Result: 350\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions to answer specific queries by identifying the correct function and input based on the desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2. Result: 'alice@gmail.com'\n\n**Example 2: Get Weather Information for a City**\n- User Query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify Burger's food ID using `t(4)`.\n  2. Call `y(4)` to get the calorie count for a Burger.\n  3. Result: 350\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions to answer specific queries by identifying the correct function and input based on the desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1.

Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1.

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2. Result: 'alice@gmail.com'\n\n**Example 2: Get Weather Information for a City**\n- User Query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify Burger's food ID using `t(4)`.\n  2. Call `y(4)` to get the calorie count for a Burger.\n  3. Result: 350\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions to answer specific queries by identifying the correct function and input based on the desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2. Result: 'alice@gmail.com'\n\n**Example 2: Get Weather Information for a City**\n- User Query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify Burger's food ID using `t(4)`.\n  2. Call `y(4)` to get the calorie count for a Burger.\n  3. Result: 350\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions to answer specific queries by identifying the correct function and input based on the desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2.

Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1.

The functions are designed to handle specific IDs and input types, and they return error messages for invalid inputs. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n\n1. **ID Ranges**: User IDs are limited to 1, location IDs are valid from 1 to 5, and food IDs are valid from 1 to 7. Ensure that inputs fall within these ranges to avoid errors.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Functions that take iterables (e.g., `c`, `x`, `z`) can handle lists, tuples, and sets. Functions that take integers expect positive integers within the valid ID ranges.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Functions return specific error messages when given invalid inputs. Use these messages to guide further exploration and testing.\n\n4. **Constant Outputs**: Some functions, like `i` and `k`, return constant values and do not require further testing unless the environment changes.\n\nTo effectively interact with the environment, start by identifying the type of information you need (e.g., user, location, food) and use the appropriate function with valid inputs. If you encounter errors, adjust the inputs based on the observed valid ranges and types.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n**Example 1: Retrieve User Information**\n- User Query: \"What is the email of user ID 1?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `v(1)` to get the email of user ID 1.\n  2. Result: 'alice@gmail.com'\n\n**Example 2: Get Weather Information for a City**\n- User Query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify New York's location ID using `w(1)`.\n  2. Call `q(1)` to get the weather information for New York.\n  3. Result: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\n**Example 3: List All Available Foods**\n- User Query: \"What foods are available?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Call `c([])` to get a list of all available foods.\n  2. Result: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Chocolate'}, ...]\n\n**Example 4: Find Calorie Count for a Specific Food**\n- User Query: \"How many calories are in a Burger?\"\n- Process:\n  1. Identify Burger's food ID using `t(4)`.\n  2. Call `y(4)` to get the calorie count for a Burger.\n  3. Result: 350\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the functions to answer specific queries by identifying the correct function and input based on the desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
