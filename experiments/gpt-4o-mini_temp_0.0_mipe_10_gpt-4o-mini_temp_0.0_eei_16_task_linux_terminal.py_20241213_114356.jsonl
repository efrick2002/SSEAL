This can help clarify any ambiguities in the function's expected behavior.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations (e.g., a file must exist before it can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls accordingly.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the state of the environment, including existing files and directories, as this will affect the outcome of your function calls.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for detailed usage instructions and examples.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the functional environment more effectively and respond to user queries with confidence.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This can help clarify any ambiguities in the function's expected behavior.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations (e.g., a file must exist before it can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls accordingly.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the state of the environment, including existing files and directories, as this will affect the outcome of your function calls.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for detailed usage instructions and examples.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the functional environment more effectively and respond to user queries with confidence.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their docstrings to understand how to use them correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential exceptions that may arise from incorrect usage, such as permission errors when trying to delete or modify files, or invalid modes when setting permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider running it with test inputs to observe the output. This can help clarify any ambiguities in the function's expected behavior.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations (e.g., a file must exist before it can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls accordingly.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the state of the environment, including existing files and directories, as this will affect the outcome of your function calls.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for detailed usage instructions and examples.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the functional environment more effectively and respond to user queries with confidence.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This can help clarify any ambiguities in the function's expected behavior.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations (e.g., a file must exist before it can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls accordingly.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the state of the environment, including existing files and directories, as this will affect the outcome of your function calls.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for detailed usage instructions and examples.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the functional environment more effectively and respond to user queries with confidence.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This can help clarify any ambiguities in the function's expected behavior.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations (e.g., a file must exist before it can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls accordingly.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the state of the environment, including existing files and directories, as this will affect the outcome of your function calls.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for detailed usage instructions and examples.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the functional environment more effectively and respond to user queries with confidence.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their docstrings to understand how to use them correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential exceptions that may arise from incorrect usage, such as permission errors when trying to delete or modify files, or invalid modes when setting permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider running it with test inputs to observe the output. This can help clarify any ambiguities in the function's expected behavior.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations (e.g., a file must exist before it can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls accordingly.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the state of the environment, including existing files and directories, as this will affect the outcome of your function calls.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for detailed usage instructions and examples.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the functional environment more effectively and respond to user queries with confidence.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their docstrings to understand how to use them correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential exceptions that may arise from incorrect usage, such as permission errors when trying to delete or modify files, or invalid modes when setting permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider running it with test inputs to observe the output. This can help clarify any ambiguities in the function's expected behavior.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations (e.g., a file must exist before it can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls accordingly.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the state of the environment, including existing files and directories, as this will affect the outcome of your function calls.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for detailed usage instructions and examples.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the functional environment more effectively and respond to user queries with confidence.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their docstrings to understand how to use them correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential exceptions that may arise from incorrect usage, such as permission errors when trying to delete or modify files, or invalid modes when setting permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider running it with test inputs to observe the output. This can help clarify any ambiguities in the function's expected behavior.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations (e.g., a file must exist before it can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls accordingly.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the state of the environment, including existing files and directories, as this will affect the outcome of your function calls.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for detailed usage instructions and examples.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the functional environment more effectively and respond to user queries with confidence.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Familiarize yourself with the function signatures and their docstrings to understand how to use them correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Be aware of potential exceptions that may arise from incorrect usage, such as permission errors when trying to delete or modify files, or invalid modes when setting permissions.\n\n3. **Testing and Validation**: When unsure about a function's behavior, consider running it with test inputs to observe the output. This can help clarify any ambiguities in the function's expected behavior.\n\n4. **Sequential Operations**: Some functions may depend on the results of previous operations (e.g., a file must exist before it can be moved or viewed). Plan your function calls accordingly.\n\n5. **Environment State**: Keep track of the state of the environment, including existing files and directories, as this will affect the outcome of your function calls.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Always refer to the updated function documentation provided above for detailed usage instructions and examples.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future agents can navigate the functional environment more effectively and respond to user queries with confidence.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
