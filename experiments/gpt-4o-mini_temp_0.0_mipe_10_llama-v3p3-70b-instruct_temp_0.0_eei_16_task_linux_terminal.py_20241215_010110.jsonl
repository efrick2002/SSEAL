The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different goals.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `look_in` function to list the files in a directory and get information about them.\n* Use the `lay_path` function to create new files or directories.\n* Use the `destory` function to delete files or directories.\n* Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for files or directories.\n* Use the `move_it` function to move files or directories.\n* Use the `view` function to view the contents of a file.\n* Use the `write_next` and `write_over` functions to write content to a file.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may have error cases, such as if a file or directory does not exist, or if an operation fails. Be sure to check the error cases for each function to ensure that you are using them correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the `super` function is unknown and its behavior is not clear. It's recommended to avoid using this function until its behavior is better understood.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment:\n\nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it\n1. Use the `lay_path` function to create a new file: `lay_path('/path/to/new_file', mode='file')`\n2. Use the `write_next` function to write content to the file: `write_next('new_file.txt', 'Hello World!')`\n3. Use the `view` function to view the contents of the file: `view('new_file.txt')`\n\nExample 2: Move a file to a new location\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `move_it` function to move a file to a new location: `move_it('/path/to/source', '/path/to/destination')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the file has been moved: `look_in('/')`\n\nExample 3: Set permissions for a file\n1. Use the `look_in` function to list the files in the current directory: `look_in('/')`\n2. Use the `mod_perms` function to set permissions for a file: `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')`\n3. Use the `look_in` function again to verify that the permissions have been set: `look_in('/')`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
