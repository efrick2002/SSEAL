Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6.

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n   - Always verify directory existence before file operations\n   - Use lay_path() to prepare directories, but exact mode is tricky\n   - Paths are sensitive; use full paths when possible\n\n2. Function Calling Strategies:\n   - Start with simple, single-argument calls\n   - Progressively test edge cases\n   - Be prepared for type-specific errors\n   - Some functions have hidden constraints\n\n3. Matching and Searching:\n   - match_it() works on partial content matches\n   - Provide multiple files for broader searches\n   - Returns matching file contents\n\n4. Permission and Environment:\n   - export_env() sets environment variables\n   - mod_perms() requires precise 9-character mode strings\n   - Some operations may require elevated permissions\n\n5. Debugging Approach:\n   - Use look_back() to review command history\n   - look_in() helps understand current directory state\n   - Systematically explore function behaviors\n   - Document unexpected results\n\n6. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions throw exceptions for invalid inputs\n   - Always have error handling mechanisms\n   - Validate paths, modes, and argument types\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nScenario 1: File Content Search\nUser Query: \"Find all files containing 'configuration'\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to list available files\n2. match_it('configuration', 'config.txt', 'log.txt')\n   - Returns 'config.txt:New configuration'\n\nScenario 2: Environment Setup for Logging\nUser Query: \"Prepare a logging directory and set a debug environment variable\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. lay_path('/tmp/logs', mode='file')\n2. export_env('DEBUG', 'true')\n3. write_over('/tmp/logs/debug.log', 'Initialization log')\n4. mod_perms('rw-rw-r--', '/tmp/logs/debug.log')\n\nScenario 3: File Movement and Permission Management\nUser Query: \"Move a configuration file to a new location and update its permissions\"\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. look_in('/') to confirm file existence\n2. move_it('config.txt', '/new/config.txt')\n3. mod_perms('rw-r--r--', '/new/config.txt')\n4. view('/new/config.txt') to verify content\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
