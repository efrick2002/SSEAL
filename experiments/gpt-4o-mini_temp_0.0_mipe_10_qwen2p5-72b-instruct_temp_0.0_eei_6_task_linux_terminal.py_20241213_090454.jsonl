The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   -

Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   -

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   -

Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The environment is designed to simulate file system operations and environment variable management.\n   - Functions like `destory`, `lay_path`, `mod_perms`, `move_it`, `view`, `write_next`, and `write_over` interact with the file system.\n   - Functions like `export_env` manage environment variables.\n   - The `look_back` function provides a history of commands executed in the environment.\n   - The `match_it` function searches for patterns in files.\n   - The `callback` function concatenates strings and returns them.\n   - The `super` function is a placeholder and does not perform any action.\n\n2. **Handling Errors**:\n   - Many functions raise exceptions if the specified paths do not exist or if the arguments are invalid.\n   - Ensure that the paths provided to functions are valid and exist before calling them.\n   - Check the command history using `look_back` to verify the sequence of operations and identify any issues.\n\n3. **Using the Environment**:\n   - To delete a file or directory, use `destory` with the appropriate path and options.\n   - To create a file or directory, use `lay_path` with the correct mode.\n   - To set environment variables, use `export_env`.\n   - To list directory contents, use `look_in` with the appropriate options.\n   - To search for patterns in files, use `match_it`.\n   - To modify file permissions, use `mod_perms` with a 9-character mode string.\n   - To move files or directories, use `move_it`.\n   - To view file contents, use `view`.\n   - To append content to a file, use `write_next`.\n   - To overwrite file content, use `write_over`.\n   - Use `look_back` to review the history of commands and their outputs.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Always check the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them.\n   - Use `look_back` to debug and understand the sequence of operations.\n   - Ensure that the `mode` parameter in `mod_perms` is a 9-character string.\n   - Use `view` to verify the contents of files after writing or appending content.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query**: \"I need to create a new directory and a file inside it, then set the file's permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for others.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Create the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory', mode='directory')\n     </function_list>\n   - Create the file inside the directory:\n     <function_list>\n     lay_path('/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt', mode='file')\n     </function_list>\n   - Set the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/new_directory/new_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n   - Verify the file's permissions:\n     <function_list>\n     look_in('/path/to/new_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     </function_list>\n\n2. **User Query**: \"I want to append some content to an existing file and then view the updated content.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Append content to the file:\n     <function_list>\n     write_next('/path/to/valid_file.txt', 'This is some new content.')\n     </function_list>\n   - View the updated file content:\n     <function_list>\n     view('/path/to/valid_file.txt')\n     </function_list>\n\n3. **User Query**: \"Can you delete a directory and all its contents, and then check if the directory still exists?\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Delete the directory and its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     destory('/path/to/valid_directory', recursive=True, force=True)\n     </function_list>\n   - Check if the directory still exists by listing its contents:\n     <function_list>\n     try:\n         look_in('/path/to/valid_directory', all=True, show_perm=True)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(e)\n     </function_list>\n   - The expected output should be an exception indicating that the directory does not exist.\n\n4. **User Query**: \"I need to set an environment variable and then check if it was set correctly.\"\n\n   **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Set the environment variable:\n     <function_list>\n     export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')\n     </function_list>\n   - Check the environment variable by listing the command history:\n     <function_list>\n     look_back()\n     </function_list>\n   - Look for the `export` command in the history to confirm the variable was set.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
