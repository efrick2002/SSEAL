Direct variable assignments or imports are not supported.\n\n2. **DataFrame Operations**: Ensure that any DataFrame operations are preceded by a `read_db` call to load the necessary data.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Pay attention to error messages. They often indicate issues with column names, table names, or the sequence of operations.\n\n4. **Logical Sequencing**: When using `execute_operations`, ensure the sequence of operations is logical. For example, read a DataFrame before attempting to select or sort it.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by listing available tables with `ls()` and understanding the database structure with `get_metadata()`. This will guide your subsequent function calls.\n\n6. **Testing Edge Cases**: Consider testing functions with edge cases, such as empty DataFrames, non-existent columns, or complex expressions, to fully understand their behavior.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently navigate the environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What is the total salary of players in each team?\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), 'team_id', {'salary': 'sum'})` to calculate the total salary for each team.\n\nExample Query 2: \"List all players with a salary greater than $30,000,000, sorted by salary.\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(read_db('player.tbl'), columns=['name', 'salary'], conditions={'salary': ('>', 30000000)})` to filter players.\n- Step 3: Use `sort(read_db('player.tbl'), columns='salary', ascending=False)` to sort the filtered players by salary.\n\nExample Query 3: \"Merge team and player data and list all players with their team names.\"\n- Step 1: Use `merge_tables(read_db('teams.tbl'), read_db('player.tbl'), on='team_id', how='inner')` to merge the data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(merged_df, columns=['name', 'team_name'])` to list players with their team names.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to approach user queries by breaking them down into a series of function calls, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Direct variable assignments or imports are not supported.\n\n2. **DataFrame Operations**: Ensure that any DataFrame operations are preceded by a `read_db` call to load the necessary data.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Pay attention to error messages. They often indicate issues with column names, table names, or the sequence of operations.\n\n4. **Logical Sequencing**: When using `execute_operations`, ensure the sequence of operations is logical. For example, read a DataFrame before attempting to select or sort it.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by listing available tables with `ls()` and understanding the database structure with `get_metadata()`. This will guide your subsequent function calls.\n\n6. **Testing Edge Cases**: Consider testing functions with edge cases, such as empty DataFrames, non-existent columns, or complex expressions, to fully understand their behavior.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently navigate the environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What is the total salary of players in each team?\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), 'team_id', {'salary': 'sum'})` to calculate the total salary for each team.\n\nExample Query 2: \"List all players with a salary greater than $30,000,000, sorted by salary.\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(read_db('player.tbl'), columns=['name', 'salary'], conditions={'salary': ('>', 30000000)})` to filter players.\n- Step 3: Use `sort(read_db('player.tbl'), columns='salary', ascending=False)` to sort the filtered players by salary.\n\nExample Query 3: \"Merge team and player data and list all players with their team names.\"\n- Step 1: Use `merge_tables(read_db('teams.tbl'), read_db('player.tbl'), on='team_id', how='inner')` to merge the data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(merged_df, columns=['name', 'team_name'])` to list players with their team names.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to approach user queries by breaking them down into a series of function calls, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Direct variable assignments or imports are not supported.\n\n2. **DataFrame Operations**: Ensure that any DataFrame operations are preceded by a `read_db` call to load the necessary data.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Pay attention to error messages. They often indicate issues with column names, table names, or the sequence of operations.\n\n4. **Logical Sequencing**: When using `execute_operations`, ensure the sequence of operations is logical. For example, read a DataFrame before attempting to select or sort it.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by listing available tables with `ls()` and understanding the database structure with `get_metadata()`. This will guide your subsequent function calls.\n\n6. **Testing Edge Cases**: Consider testing functions with edge cases, such as empty DataFrames, non-existent columns, or complex expressions, to fully understand their behavior.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently navigate the environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What is the total salary of players in each team?\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), 'team_id', {'salary': 'sum'})` to calculate the total salary for each team.\n\nExample Query 2: \"List all players with a salary greater than $30,000,000, sorted by salary.\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(read_db('player.tbl'), columns=['name', 'salary'], conditions={'salary': ('>', 30000000)})` to filter players.\n- Step 3: Use `sort(read_db('player.tbl'), columns='salary', ascending=False)` to sort the filtered players by salary.\n\nExample Query 3: \"Merge team and player data and list all players with their team names.\"\n- Step 1: Use `merge_tables(read_db('teams.tbl'), read_db('player.tbl'), on='team_id', how='inner')` to merge the data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(merged_df, columns=['name', 'team_name'])` to list players with their team names.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to approach user queries by breaking them down into a series of function calls, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Direct variable assignments or imports are not supported.\n\n2. **DataFrame Operations**: Ensure that any DataFrame operations are preceded by a `read_db` call to load the necessary data.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Pay attention to error messages. They often indicate issues with column names, table names, or the sequence of operations.\n\n4. **Logical Sequencing**: When using `execute_operations`, ensure the sequence of operations is logical. For example, read a DataFrame before attempting to select or sort it.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by listing available tables with `ls()` and understanding the database structure with `get_metadata()`. This will guide your subsequent function calls.\n\n6. **Testing Edge Cases**: Consider testing functions with edge cases, such as empty DataFrames, non-existent columns, or complex expressions, to fully understand their behavior.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently navigate the environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What is the total salary of players in each team?\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), 'team_id', {'salary': 'sum'})` to calculate the total salary for each team.\n\nExample Query 2: \"List all players with a salary greater than $30,000,000, sorted by salary.\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(read_db('player.tbl'), columns=['name', 'salary'], conditions={'salary': ('>', 30000000)})` to filter players.\n- Step 3: Use `sort(read_db('player.tbl'), columns='salary', ascending=False)` to sort the filtered players by salary.\n\nExample Query 3: \"Merge team and player data and list all players with their team names.\"\n- Step 1: Use `merge_tables(read_db('teams.tbl'), read_db('player.tbl'), on='team_id', how='inner')` to merge the data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(merged_df, columns=['name', 'team_name'])` to list players with their team names.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to approach user queries by breaking them down into a series of function calls, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Direct variable assignments or imports are not supported.\n\n2. **DataFrame Operations**: Ensure that any DataFrame operations are preceded by a `read_db` call to load the necessary data.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Pay attention to error messages. They often indicate issues with column names, table names, or the sequence of operations.\n\n4. **Logical Sequencing**: When using `execute_operations`, ensure the sequence of operations is logical. For example, read a DataFrame before attempting to select or sort it.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by listing available tables with `ls()` and understanding the database structure with `get_metadata()`. This will guide your subsequent function calls.\n\n6. **Testing Edge Cases**: Consider testing functions with edge cases, such as empty DataFrames, non-existent columns, or complex expressions, to fully understand their behavior.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently navigate the environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What is the total salary of players in each team?\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), 'team_id', {'salary': 'sum'})` to calculate the total salary for each team.\n\nExample Query 2: \"List all players with a salary greater than $30,000,000, sorted by salary.\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(read_db('player.tbl'), columns=['name', 'salary'], conditions={'salary': ('>', 30000000)})` to filter players.\n- Step 3: Use `sort(read_db('player.tbl'), columns='salary', ascending=False)` to sort the filtered players by salary.\n\nExample Query 3: \"Merge team and player data and list all players with their team names.\"\n- Step 1: Use `merge_tables(read_db('teams.tbl'), read_db('player.tbl'), on='team_id', how='inner')` to merge the data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(merged_df, columns=['name', 'team_name'])` to list players with their team names.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to approach user queries by breaking them down into a series of function calls, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Direct variable assignments or imports are not supported.\n\n2. **DataFrame Operations**: Ensure that any DataFrame operations are preceded by a `read_db` call to load the necessary data.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Pay attention to error messages. They often indicate issues with column names, table names, or the sequence of operations.\n\n4. **Logical Sequencing**: When using `execute_operations`, ensure the sequence of operations is logical. For example, read a DataFrame before attempting to select or sort it.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by listing available tables with `ls()` and understanding the database structure with `get_metadata()`. This will guide your subsequent function calls.\n\n6. **Testing Edge Cases**: Consider testing functions with edge cases, such as empty DataFrames, non-existent columns, or complex expressions, to fully understand their behavior.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently navigate the environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What is the total salary of players in each team?\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), 'team_id', {'salary': 'sum'})` to calculate the total salary for each team.\n\nExample Query 2: \"List all players with a salary greater than $30,000,000, sorted by salary.\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(read_db('player.tbl'), columns=['name', 'salary'], conditions={'salary': ('>', 30000000)})` to filter players.\n- Step 3: Use `sort(read_db('player.tbl'), columns='salary', ascending=False)` to sort the filtered players by salary.\n\nExample Query 3: \"Merge team and player data and list all players with their team names.\"\n- Step 1: Use `merge_tables(read_db('teams.tbl'), read_db('player.tbl'), on='team_id', how='inner')` to merge the data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(merged_df, columns=['name', 'team_name'])` to list players with their team names.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to approach user queries by breaking them down into a series of function calls, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Direct variable assignments or imports are not supported.\n\n2. **DataFrame Operations**: Ensure that any DataFrame operations are preceded by a `read_db` call to load the necessary data.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Pay attention to error messages. They often indicate issues with column names, table names, or the sequence of operations.\n\n4. **Logical Sequencing**: When using `execute_operations`, ensure the sequence of operations is logical. For example, read a DataFrame before attempting to select or sort it.\n\n5. **Exploration Strategy**: Start by listing available tables with `ls()` and understanding the database structure with `get_metadata()`. This will guide your subsequent function calls.\n\n6. **Testing Edge Cases**: Consider testing functions with edge cases, such as empty DataFrames, non-existent columns, or complex expressions, to fully understand their behavior.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently navigate the environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample Query 1: \"What is the total salary of players in each team?\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `aggregate(read_db('player.tbl'), 'team_id', {'salary': 'sum'})` to calculate the total salary for each team.\n\nExample Query 2: \"List all players with a salary greater than $30,000,000, sorted by salary.\"\n- Step 1: Use `read_db('player.tbl')` to load the player data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(read_db('player.tbl'), columns=['name', 'salary'], conditions={'salary': ('>', 30000000)})` to filter players.\n- Step 3: Use `sort(read_db('player.tbl'), columns='salary', ascending=False)` to sort the filtered players by salary.\n\nExample Query 3: \"Merge team and player data and list all players with their team names.\"\n- Step 1: Use `merge_tables(read_db('teams.tbl'), read_db('player.tbl'), on='team_id', how='inner')` to merge the data.\n- Step 2: Use `select(merged_df, columns=['name', 'team_name'])` to list players with their team names.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to approach user queries by breaking them down into a series of function calls, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
