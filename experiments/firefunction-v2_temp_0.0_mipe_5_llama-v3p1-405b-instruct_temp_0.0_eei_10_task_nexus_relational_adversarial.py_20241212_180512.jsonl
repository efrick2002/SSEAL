The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the expected output or an error message if the input is invalid.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct data type for each argument. For example, the `b` function expects an integer argument, while the `c` function expects a string argument.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `f` and `g`, will return a user object or a location object, respectively, for a given ID. These objects contain additional information about the user or location.\n\nWhen working with the environment, it's essential to handle error cases properly. For example, if a function returns an error message, you should be able to handle it and provide a meaningful response to the user.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use a combination of functions to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the current weather in New York, you can call the `q` function with the location ID for New York to retrieve the current weather.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the functions provided, you should be able to navigate the environment and provide accurate responses to user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: User asks for the current weather in New York\n\n1. Call the `w` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the city name.\n2. Call the `q` function with the location ID for New York (1) to retrieve the current weather.\n3. Return the current weather to the user.\n\nExample 2: User asks for the calorie count of a pizza\n\n1. Call the `h` function with the food ID for pizza (1) to retrieve the food object.\n2. Extract the calorie count from the food object.\n3. Return the calorie count to the user.\n\nExample 3: User asks for the list of users\n\n1. Call the `z` function with a list of user IDs (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) to retrieve the list of user objects.\n2. Return the list of user objects to the user.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
