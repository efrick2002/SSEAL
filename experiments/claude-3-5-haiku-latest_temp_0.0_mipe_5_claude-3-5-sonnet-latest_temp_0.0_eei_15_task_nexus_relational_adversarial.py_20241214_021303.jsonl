VALID IDs:\n- Users: 1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43\n- Locations: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n- Foods: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\n2. Function Categories:\n- User functions (b, f, m, v, z, i, k)\n- Location functions (e, g, q, r, w, x)\n- Food functions (c, h, t, u, y)\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs throw exceptions\n- Wrong type inputs throw TypeError\n- All functions handle errors consistently\n\n4. List Functions (c, x, z):\n- Take string parameter that affects ordering\n- Always return complete lists\n- Order may vary but content is consistent\n\n5. Query Strategy:\n- Start with list functions (k, x, c) to get valid IDs\n- Use detailed functions (f, g, h) for full information\n- Use specific functions (v, w, t) for single properties\n\n6. Data Relationships:\n- Users have locations and favorite foods\n- Locations have times and weather\n- Foods have calories and allergens\n\n7. Testing Approach:\n- Verify ID validity first\n- Test with known good inputs\n- Cross-reference related functions\n- Verify error cases explicitly\n\nRemember to structure function calls in <function_list> tags and expect dictionary output describing calls and results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all users who like Pizza (ID 1)\"\n```python\n# First get all user IDs\nk()  # Get list of all users\n# Then check each user's favorite foods\nm(1)  # Check Alice's favorites -> [1, 2, 3] (includes 1)\nm(21)  # Check Bob's favorites -> [4, 5, 6] (no 1)\nm(35)  # Check Charlie's favorites -> [3, 7, 2] (no 1)\nm(41)  # Check Donna's favorites -> [6, 1, 4] (includes 1)\nm(42)  # Check Eve's favorites -> [5, 7, 4] (no 1)\nm(43)  # Check Frank's favorites -> [3] (no 1)\n# Result: Alice and Donna like Pizza\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Eve lives?\"\n```python\n# First get Eve's location\nf(42)  # Get Eve's full profile -> location: 5\n# Then get weather for that location\nq(5)  # Get weather -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F\"\n```\n\nExample 3: \"List all foods with dairy allergies\"\n```python\n# Get all food IDs\nc(\"\")  # Get list of all foods\n# Check each food's allergens\nu(1)  # Pizza -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(2)  # Chocolate -> ['Milk', 'Soy']\nu(3)  # Sushi -> ['Fish', 'Soy']\nu(4)  # Burger -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(5)  # Ice Cream -> ['Dairy']\nu(6)  # Pasta -> ['Gluten']\nu(7)  # Salad -> []\n# Result: Pizza, Chocolate, Burger, Ice Cream contain dairy\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Query Strategy:\n- Start with list functions (k, x, c) to get valid IDs\n- Use detailed functions (f, g, h) for full information\n- Use specific functions (v, w, t) for single properties\n\n6. Data Relationships:\n- Users have locations and favorite foods\n- Locations have times and weather\n- Foods have calories and allergens\n\n7. Testing Approach:\n- Verify ID validity first\n- Test with known good inputs\n- Cross-reference related functions\n- Verify error cases explicitly\n\nRemember to structure function calls in <function_list> tags and expect dictionary output describing calls and results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all users who like Pizza (ID 1)\"\n```python\n# First get all user IDs\nk()  # Get list of all users\n# Then check each user's favorite foods\nm(1)  # Check Alice's favorites -> [1, 2, 3] (includes 1)\nm(21)  # Check Bob's favorites -> [4, 5, 6] (no 1)\nm(35)  # Check Charlie's favorites -> [3, 7, 2] (no 1)\nm(41)  # Check Donna's favorites -> [6, 1, 4] (includes 1)\nm(42)  # Check Eve's favorites -> [5, 7, 4] (no 1)\nm(43)  # Check Frank's favorites -> [3] (no 1)\n# Result: Alice and Donna like Pizza\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Eve lives?\"\n```python\n# First get Eve's location\nf(42)  # Get Eve's full profile -> location: 5\n# Then get weather for that location\nq(5)  # Get weather -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F\"\n```\n\nExample 3: \"List all foods with dairy allergies\"\n```python\n# Get all food IDs\nc(\"\")  # Get list of all foods\n# Check each food's allergens\nu(1)  # Pizza -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(2)  # Chocolate -> ['Milk', 'Soy']\nu(3)  # Sushi -> ['Fish', 'Soy']\nu(4)  # Burger -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(5)  # Ice Cream -> ['Dairy']\nu(6)  # Pasta -> ['Gluten']\nu(7)  # Salad -> []\n# Result: Pizza, Chocolate, Burger, Ice Cream contain dairy\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

VALID IDs:\n- Users: 1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43\n- Locations: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n- Foods: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\n2. Function Categories:\n- User functions (b, f, m, v, z, i, k)\n- Location functions (e, g, q, r, w, x)\n- Food functions (c, h, t, u, y)\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs throw exceptions\n- Wrong type inputs throw TypeError\n- All functions handle errors consistently\n\n4. List Functions (c, x, z):\n- Take string parameter that affects ordering\n- Always return complete lists\n- Order may vary but content is consistent\n\n5. Query Strategy:\n- Start with list functions (k, x, c) to get valid IDs\n- Use detailed functions (f, g, h) for full information\n- Use specific functions (v, w, t) for single properties\n\n6. Data Relationships:\n- Users have locations and favorite foods\n- Locations have times and weather\n- Foods have calories and allergens\n\n7. Testing Approach:\n- Verify ID validity first\n- Test with known good inputs\n- Cross-reference related functions\n- Verify error cases explicitly\n\nRemember to structure function calls in <function_list> tags and expect dictionary output describing calls and results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all users who like Pizza (ID 1)\"\n```python\n# First get all user IDs\nk()  # Get list of all users\n# Then check each user's favorite foods\nm(1)  # Check Alice's favorites -> [1, 2, 3] (includes 1)\nm(21)  # Check Bob's favorites -> [4, 5, 6] (no 1)\nm(35)  # Check Charlie's favorites -> [3, 7, 2] (no 1)\nm(41)  # Check Donna's favorites -> [6, 1, 4] (includes 1)\nm(42)  # Check Eve's favorites -> [5, 7, 4] (no 1)\nm(43)  # Check Frank's favorites -> [3] (no 1)\n# Result: Alice and Donna like Pizza\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Eve lives?\"\n```python\n# First get Eve's location\nf(42)  # Get Eve's full profile -> location: 5\n# Then get weather for that location\nq(5)  # Get weather -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F\"\n```\n\nExample 3: \"List all foods with dairy allergies\"\n```python\n# Get all food IDs\nc(\"\")  # Get list of all foods\n# Check each food's allergens\nu(1)  # Pizza -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(2)  # Chocolate -> ['Milk', 'Soy']\nu(3)  # Sushi -> ['Fish', 'Soy']\nu(4)  # Burger -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(5)  # Ice Cream -> ['Dairy']\nu(6)  # Pasta -> ['Gluten']\nu(7)  # Salad -> []\n# Result: Pizza, Chocolate, Burger, Ice Cream contain dairy\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Categories:\n- User functions (b, f, m, v, z, i, k)\n- Location functions (e, g, q, r, w, x)\n- Food functions (c, h, t, u, y)\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs throw exceptions\n- Wrong type inputs throw TypeError\n- All functions handle errors consistently\n\n4. List Functions (c, x, z):\n- Take string parameter that affects ordering\n- Always return complete lists\n- Order may vary but content is consistent\n\n5. Query Strategy:\n- Start with list functions (k, x, c) to get valid IDs\n- Use detailed functions (f, g, h) for full information\n- Use specific functions (v, w, t) for single properties\n\n6. Data Relationships:\n- Users have locations and favorite foods\n- Locations have times and weather\n- Foods have calories and allergens\n\n7. Testing Approach:\n- Verify ID validity first\n- Test with known good inputs\n- Cross-reference related functions\n- Verify error cases explicitly\n\nRemember to structure function calls in <function_list> tags and expect dictionary output describing calls and results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all users who like Pizza (ID 1)\"\n```python\n# First get all user IDs\nk()  # Get list of all users\n# Then check each user's favorite foods\nm(1)  # Check Alice's favorites -> [1, 2, 3] (includes 1)\nm(21)  # Check Bob's favorites -> [4, 5, 6] (no 1)\nm(35)  # Check Charlie's favorites -> [3, 7, 2] (no 1)\nm(41)  # Check Donna's favorites -> [6, 1, 4] (includes 1)\nm(42)  # Check Eve's favorites -> [5, 7, 4] (no 1)\nm(43)  # Check Frank's favorites -> [3] (no 1)\n# Result: Alice and Donna like Pizza\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Eve lives?\"\n```python\n# First get Eve's location\nf(42)  # Get Eve's full profile -> location: 5\n# Then get weather for that location\nq(5)  # Get weather -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F\"\n```\n\nExample 3: \"List all foods with dairy allergies\"\n```python\n# Get all food IDs\nc(\"\")  # Get list of all foods\n# Check each food's allergens\nu(1)  # Pizza -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(2)  # Chocolate -> ['Milk', 'Soy']\nu(3)  # Sushi -> ['Fish', 'Soy']\nu(4)  # Burger -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(5)  # Ice Cream -> ['Dairy']\nu(6)  # Pasta -> ['Gluten']\nu(7)  # Salad -> []\n# Result: Pizza, Chocolate, Burger, Ice Cream contain dairy\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nKey points for operating in this environment:\n\n1. VALID IDs:\n- Users: 1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43\n- Locations: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n- Foods: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\n2. Function Categories:\n- User functions (b, f, m, v, z, i, k)\n- Location functions (e, g, q, r, w, x)\n- Food functions (c, h, t, u, y)\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Invalid IDs throw exceptions\n- Wrong type inputs throw TypeError\n- All functions handle errors consistently\n\n4. List Functions (c, x, z):\n- Take string parameter that affects ordering\n- Always return complete lists\n- Order may vary but content is consistent\n\n5. Query Strategy:\n- Start with list functions (k, x, c) to get valid IDs\n- Use detailed functions (f, g, h) for full information\n- Use specific functions (v, w, t) for single properties\n\n6. Data Relationships:\n- Users have locations and favorite foods\n- Locations have times and weather\n- Foods have calories and allergens\n\n7. Testing Approach:\n- Verify ID validity first\n- Test with known good inputs\n- Cross-reference related functions\n- Verify error cases explicitly\n\nRemember to structure function calls in <function_list> tags and expect dictionary output describing calls and results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Find all users who like Pizza (ID 1)\"\n```python\n# First get all user IDs\nk()  # Get list of all users\n# Then check each user's favorite foods\nm(1)  # Check Alice's favorites -> [1, 2, 3] (includes 1)\nm(21)  # Check Bob's favorites -> [4, 5, 6] (no 1)\nm(35)  # Check Charlie's favorites -> [3, 7, 2] (no 1)\nm(41)  # Check Donna's favorites -> [6, 1, 4] (includes 1)\nm(42)  # Check Eve's favorites -> [5, 7, 4] (no 1)\nm(43)  # Check Frank's favorites -> [3] (no 1)\n# Result: Alice and Donna like Pizza\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the weather like where Eve lives?\"\n```python\n# First get Eve's location\nf(42)  # Get Eve's full profile -> location: 5\n# Then get weather for that location\nq(5)  # Get weather -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 80\u00b0F\"\n```\n\nExample 3: \"List all foods with dairy allergies\"\n```python\n# Get all food IDs\nc(\"\")  # Get list of all foods\n# Check each food's allergens\nu(1)  # Pizza -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(2)  # Chocolate -> ['Milk', 'Soy']\nu(3)  # Sushi -> ['Fish', 'Soy']\nu(4)  # Burger -> ['Gluten', 'Dairy']\nu(5)  # Ice Cream -> ['Dairy']\nu(6)  # Pasta -> ['Gluten']\nu(7)  # Salad -> []\n# Result: Pizza, Chocolate, Burger, Ice Cream contain dairy\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
