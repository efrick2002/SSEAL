Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4.

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with the environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, and foods. The functions can be used to answer user queries by calling them with the relevant arguments.\n\nFor example, to find the favorite foods of a user, you can call the `get_user_favorite_foods` function with the user's ID as an argument. To find the current weather at a location, you can call the `get_weather_at_location` function with the location's ID as an argument.\n\nIt's also important to note that some functions may return lists or dictionaries, so you may need to access specific elements or keys to get the desired information.\n\nWhen using the environment, make sure to check the function descriptors and examples to understand how to use each function correctly. Additionally, be aware of any potential errors or ambiguities that may arise when using the functions.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant function(s) to call based on the query.\n2. Call the function(s) with the relevant arguments.\n3. Access the desired information from the function's output.\n4. Return the answer to the user query.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided functions, you can effectively interact with the environment and answer user queries.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user.\n\nUser query: \"What are the favorite foods of user 1?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `get_user_info(1)` to get the user's data\n* `get_user_favorite_foods(1)` to get the user's favorite foods\nOutput: `[1, 2, 3]`\nAnswer: \"The favorite foods of user 1 are Pizza, Chocolate, and Sushi.\"\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location.\n\nUser query: \"What is the current weather in New York?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID\n* `get_weather_at_location(1)` to get the current weather\nOutput: \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\nAnswer: \"The current weather in New York is Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F.\"\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food.\n\nUser query: \"How many calories are in a serving of Pizza?\"\nFunction calls:\n* `find_foods_by_name(\"Pizza\")` to get the food ID\n* `get_food_calories(1)` to get the calories per serving\nOutput: `285`\nAnswer: \"A serving of Pizza has 285 calories.\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
