effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Each function may return either a successful result or an error message. Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to interpret results correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return specific error messages when user IDs or location IDs cannot be resolved. Use these messages to guide further queries.\n\n3. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct input types are used for each function. For example, some functions expect lists, while others expect integers.\n\n4. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not return the expected result, try different inputs based on the error messages received. This can help narrow down valid inputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of each function's purpose, expected inputs, and outputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If unsure about a function's behavior, consider calling it with various inputs to observe the outputs and refine your understanding.\n\n7. **Combining Results**: Some tasks may require combining results from multiple function calls. Plan your queries accordingly to gather all necessary information.\n\n8. **Use of Lists**: When using functions that accept lists, ensure that the list is formatted correctly and contains valid IDs.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

message. Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to interpret results correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return specific error messages when user IDs or location IDs cannot be resolved. Use these messages to guide further queries.\n\n3. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct input types are used for each function. For example, some functions expect lists, while others expect integers.\n\n4. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not return the expected result, try different inputs based on the error messages received. This can help narrow down valid inputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of each function's purpose, expected inputs, and outputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If unsure about a function's behavior, consider calling it with various inputs to observe the outputs and refine your understanding.\n\n7. **Combining Results**: Some tasks may require combining results from multiple function calls. Plan your queries accordingly to gather all necessary information.\n\n8. **Use of Lists**: When using functions that accept lists, ensure that the list is formatted correctly and contains valid IDs.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Each function may return either a successful result or an error message. Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to interpret results correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return specific error messages when user IDs or location IDs cannot be resolved. Use these messages to guide further queries.\n\n3. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct input types are used for each function. For example, some functions expect lists, while others expect integers.\n\n4. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not return the expected result, try different inputs based on the error messages received. This can help narrow down valid inputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of each function's purpose, expected inputs, and outputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If unsure about a function's behavior, consider calling it with various inputs to observe the outputs and refine your understanding.\n\n7. **Combining Results**: Some tasks may require combining results from multiple function calls. Plan your queries accordingly to gather all necessary information.\n\n8. **Use of Lists**: When using functions that accept lists, ensure that the list is formatted correctly and contains valid IDs.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, some functions expect lists, while others expect integers.\n\n4. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not return the expected result, try different inputs based on the error messages received. This can help narrow down valid inputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of each function's purpose, expected inputs, and outputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If unsure about a function's behavior, consider calling it with various inputs to observe the outputs and refine your understanding.\n\n7. **Combining Results**: Some tasks may require combining results from multiple function calls.

     Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Each function may return either a successful result or an error message. Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to interpret results correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return specific error messages when user IDs or location IDs cannot be resolved. Use these messages to guide further queries.\n\n3. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct input types are used for each function. For example, some functions expect lists, while others expect integers.\n\n4. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not return the expected result, try different inputs based on the error messages received. This can help narrow down valid inputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of each function's purpose, expected inputs, and outputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If unsure about a function's behavior, consider calling it with various inputs to observe the outputs and refine your understanding.\n\n7. **Combining Results**: Some tasks may require combining results from multiple function calls. Plan your queries accordingly to gather all necessary information.\n\n8. **Use of Lists**: When using functions that accept lists, ensure that the list is formatted correctly and contains valid IDs.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

     Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Each function may return either a successful result or an error message. Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to interpret results correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return specific error messages when user IDs or location IDs cannot be resolved. Use these messages to guide further queries.\n\n3. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct input types are used for each function. For example, some functions expect lists, while others expect integers.\n\n4. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not return the expected result, try different inputs based on the error messages received. This can help narrow down valid inputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of each function's purpose, expected inputs, and outputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If unsure about a function's behavior, consider calling it with various inputs to observe the outputs and refine your understanding.\n\n7. **Combining Results**: Some tasks may require combining results from multiple function calls. Plan your queries accordingly to gather all necessary information.\n\n8. **Use of Lists**: When using functions that accept lists, ensure that the list is formatted correctly and contains valid IDs.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

     Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, future agents should follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Each function may return either a successful result or an error message. Familiarize yourself with the expected outputs to interpret results correctly.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Many functions return specific error messages when user IDs or location IDs cannot be resolved. Use these messages to guide further queries.\n\n3. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct input types are used for each function. For example, some functions expect lists, while others expect integers.\n\n4. **Iterative Testing**: If a function does not return the expected result, try different inputs based on the error messages received. This can help narrow down valid inputs.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Refer to the updated function documentation for detailed descriptions of each function's purpose, expected inputs, and outputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If unsure about a function's behavior, consider calling it with various inputs to observe the outputs and refine your understanding.\n\n7. **Combining Results**: Some tasks may require combining results from multiple function calls. Plan your queries accordingly to gather all necessary information.\n\n8. **Use of Lists**: When using functions that accept lists, ensure that the list is formatted correctly and contains valid IDs.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
