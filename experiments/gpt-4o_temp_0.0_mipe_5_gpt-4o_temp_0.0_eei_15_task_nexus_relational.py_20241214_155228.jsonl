</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_users_by_name`. These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4. Document your findings and any patterns observed in the function outputs to aid future interactions.\n\nFor future agents, it is recommended to follow a systematic approach to explore and understand the environment, similar to the process outlined above. This involves proposing function calls, analyzing outputs, and iterating based on observations.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Finding a user's favorite foods and their details.\n- User Query: \"What are Alice's favorite foods and their details?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Alice\")` to get Alice's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_favorite_foods(user_id)` to get the list of favorite food IDs.\n  3. For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_users_by_name(\"Bob\")` to get Bob's user ID.\n  2. Use the user ID to call `get_user_info(user_id)` to retrieve Bob's complete profile, including email, location, favorite color, and favorite foods.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

<additional_information>\n        \nWhen interacting with the environment, it is important to understand the broad nature of some search functions like `find_foods_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`,

These functions return a general list of results rather than strictly filtering by the input name. \n\nTo effectively explore the environment:\n1. Start by identifying the function you need based on the information you want to retrieve.\n2. Use specific IDs for functions that require them, as they are crucial for retrieving accurate data.\n3. If a function's behavior is unclear, propose multiple calls with different inputs to observe the results and understand the function's behavior.\n4.

For each food ID, call `get_food_info(food_id)` to get detailed information about each food.\n\nExample 2: Checking the current weather in a specific city.\n- User Query: \"What's the current weather in New York?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `find_locations_by_name(\"New York\")` to get the location ID for New York.\n  2. Use the location ID to call `get_weather_at_location(location_id)` to get the current weather information.\n\nExample 3: Retrieving a user's complete profile.\n- User Query: \"Provide a complete profile for the user named Bob.\"\n- Steps:\n  1.
