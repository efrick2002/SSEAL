evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to understand the expected inputs and outputs of each function. When testing functions, ensure that the paths and files you reference exist in the environment to avoid errors related to non-existent paths. Use the `look_in` function to verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them. The `look_back` function can be useful to review recent actions and understand the sequence of operations. When modifying permissions or moving files, ensure that the paths are correct and accessible. If you encounter permission issues, consider using the `super` function to escalate privileges. Always handle exceptions gracefully to understand the cause of errors and adjust your approach accordingly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query:** \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to/dir')` to verify the directory exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `destory('/path/to/dir', recursive=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n2. **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `view('/path/to/file.txt')` to display the file's contents.\n\n3. **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')` to change the file's permissions.\n\n4. **User Query:** \"How can I set an environment variable?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Call `export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')` to set the environment variable.\n   - **Step 2:** Use `look_back()` to confirm the operation was successful.\n\nBy following these steps and using the functions as described, future agents can efficiently navigate and utilize the environment to address user queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to understand the expected inputs and outputs of each function. When testing functions, ensure that the paths and files you reference exist in the environment to avoid errors related to non-existent paths. Use the `look_in` function to verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them. The `look_back` function can be useful to review recent actions and understand the sequence of operations. When modifying permissions or moving files, ensure that the paths are correct and accessible. If you encounter permission issues, consider using the `super` function to escalate privileges. Always handle exceptions gracefully to understand the cause of errors and adjust your approach accordingly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query:** \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to/dir')` to verify the directory exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `destory('/path/to/dir', recursive=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n2. **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `view('/path/to/file.txt')` to display the file's contents.\n\n3. **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')` to change the file's permissions.\n\n4. **User Query:** \"How can I set an environment variable?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Call `export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')` to set the environment variable.\n   - **Step 2:** Use `look_back()` to confirm the operation was successful.\n\nBy following these steps and using the functions as described, future agents can efficiently navigate and utilize the environment to address user queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to understand the expected inputs and outputs of each function. When testing functions, ensure that the paths and files you reference exist in the environment to avoid errors related to non-existent paths. Use the `look_in` function to verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them. The `look_back` function can be useful to review recent actions and understand the sequence of operations. When modifying permissions or moving files, ensure that the paths are correct and accessible. If you encounter permission issues, consider using the `super` function to escalate privileges. Always handle exceptions gracefully to understand the cause of errors and adjust your approach accordingly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query:** \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to/dir')` to verify the directory exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `destory('/path/to/dir', recursive=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n2. **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `view('/path/to/file.txt')` to display the file's contents.\n\n3. **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')` to change the file's permissions.\n\n4. **User Query:** \"How can I set an environment variable?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Call `export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')` to set the environment variable.\n   - **Step 2:** Use `look_back()` to confirm the operation was successful.\n\nBy following these steps and using the functions as described, future agents can efficiently navigate and utilize the environment to address user queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to understand the expected inputs and outputs of each function. When testing functions, ensure that the paths and files you reference exist in the environment to avoid errors related to non-existent paths. Use the `look_in` function to verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them. The `look_back` function can be useful to review recent actions and understand the sequence of operations. When modifying permissions or moving files, ensure that the paths are correct and accessible. If you encounter permission issues, consider using the `super` function to escalate privileges. Always handle exceptions gracefully to understand the cause of errors and adjust your approach accordingly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query:** \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to/dir')` to verify the directory exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `destory('/path/to/dir', recursive=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n2. **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `view('/path/to/file.txt')` to display the file's contents.\n\n3. **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')` to change the file's permissions.\n\n4. **User Query:** \"How can I set an environment variable?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Call `export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')` to set the environment variable.\n   - **Step 2:** Use `look_back()` to confirm the operation was successful.\n\nBy following these steps and using the functions as described, future agents can efficiently navigate and utilize the environment to address user queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to understand the expected inputs and outputs of each function. When testing functions, ensure that the paths and files you reference exist in the environment to avoid errors related to non-existent paths. Use the `look_in` function to verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them. The `look_back` function can be useful to review recent actions and understand the sequence of operations. When modifying permissions or moving files, ensure that the paths are correct and accessible. If you encounter permission issues, consider using the `super` function to escalate privileges. Always handle exceptions gracefully to understand the cause of errors and adjust your approach accordingly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query:** \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to/dir')` to verify the directory exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `destory('/path/to/dir', recursive=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n2. **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `view('/path/to/file.txt')` to display the file's contents.\n\n3. **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')` to change the file's permissions.\n\n4. **User Query:** \"How can I set an environment variable?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Call `export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')` to set the environment variable.\n   - **Step 2:** Use `look_back()` to confirm the operation was successful.\n\nBy following these steps and using the functions as described, future agents can efficiently navigate and utilize the environment to address user queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

crucial to understand the expected inputs and outputs of each function. When testing functions, ensure that the paths and files you reference exist in the environment to avoid errors related to non-existent paths. Use the `look_in` function to verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them. The `look_back` function can be useful to review recent actions and understand the sequence of operations. When modifying permissions or moving files, ensure that the paths are correct and accessible. If you encounter permission issues, consider using the `super` function to escalate privileges. Always handle exceptions gracefully to understand the cause of errors and adjust your approach accordingly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query:** \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to/dir')` to verify the directory exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `destory('/path/to/dir', recursive=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n2. **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `view('/path/to/file.txt')` to display the file's contents.\n\n3. **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')` to change the file's permissions.\n\n4. **User Query:** \"How can I set an environment variable?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Call `export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')` to set the environment variable.\n   - **Step 2:** Use `look_back()` to confirm the operation was successful.\n\nBy following these steps and using the functions as described, future agents can efficiently navigate and utilize the environment to address user queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, it is crucial to understand the expected inputs and outputs of each function. When testing functions, ensure that the paths and files you reference exist in the environment to avoid errors related to non-existent paths. Use the `look_in` function to verify the existence of files and directories before performing operations on them. The `look_back` function can be useful to review recent actions and understand the sequence of operations. When modifying permissions or moving files, ensure that the paths are correct and accessible. If you encounter permission issues, consider using the `super` function to escalate privileges. Always handle exceptions gracefully to understand the cause of errors and adjust your approach accordingly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n1. **User Query:** \"How can I delete a directory and all its contents?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to/dir')` to verify the directory exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `destory('/path/to/dir', recursive=True)` to delete the directory and its contents.\n\n2. **User Query:** \"How can I view the contents of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `view('/path/to/file.txt')` to display the file's contents.\n\n3. **User Query:** \"How can I change the permissions of a file?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Use `look_in('/path/to')` to verify the file exists.\n   - **Step 2:** Call `mod_perms('rwxr-xr-x', '/path/to/file')` to change the file's permissions.\n\n4. **User Query:** \"How can I set an environment variable?\"\n   - **Step 1:** Call `export_env('MY_VAR', 'my_value')` to set the environment variable.\n   - **Step 2:** Use `look_back()` to confirm the operation was successful.\n\nBy following these steps and using the functions as described, future agents can efficiently navigate and utilize the environment to address user queries.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
