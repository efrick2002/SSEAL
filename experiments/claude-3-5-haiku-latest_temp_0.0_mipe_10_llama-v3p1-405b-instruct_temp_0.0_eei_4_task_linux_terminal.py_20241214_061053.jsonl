Some functions may throw exceptions if the arguments are invalid or if the operation fails.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use the functions to perform tasks such as creating files and directories, listing directory contents, searching for patterns in files, modifying file permissions, moving files and directories, and writing content to files.\n\nWhen interacting with the environment, keep in mind the following:\n\n* File paths should be absolute and start with a forward slash (/).\n* Directory paths should end with a forward slash (/).\n* File and directory names should not contain spaces or special characters.\n* Permission modes should be in the format of 'rwxr-xr-x' or '755'.\n* Pattern searching is case-sensitive.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the provided functions, you should be able to navigate this functional environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it.\n\nUser Query: Create a new file called 'example.txt' and write 'Hello, world!' to it.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/example.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n2. Call `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello, world!')` to write the content.\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory.\n\nUser Query: List the contents of the '/path/to/directory' directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\nUser Query: Search for the pattern 'example' in the 'example.txt' file.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `match_it('example', '/path/to/example.txt')` to search for the pattern.\n\nExample 4: Move a file to a new location.\n\nUser Query: Move the 'example.txt' file to the '/path/to/new/directory' directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `move_it('/path/to/example.txt', '/path/to/new/directory')` to move the file.\n\nBy following these examples and using the provided functions, you should be able to answer user queries and perform various tasks in this functional environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Some functions may throw exceptions if the arguments are invalid or if the operation fails.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use the functions to perform tasks such as creating files and directories, listing directory contents, searching for patterns in files, modifying file permissions, moving files and directories, and writing content to files.\n\nWhen interacting with the environment, keep in mind the following:\n\n* File paths should be absolute and start with a forward slash (/).\n* Directory paths should end with a forward slash (/).\n* File and directory names should not contain spaces or special characters.\n* Permission modes should be in the format of 'rwxr-xr-x' or '755'.\n* Pattern searching is case-sensitive.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the provided functions, you should be able to navigate this functional environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it.\n\nUser Query: Create a new file called 'example.txt' and write 'Hello, world!' to it.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/example.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n2. Call `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello, world!')` to write the content.\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory.\n\nUser Query: List the contents of the '/path/to/directory' directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\nUser Query: Search for the pattern 'example' in the 'example.txt' file.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `match_it('example', '/path/to/example.txt')` to search for the pattern.\n\nExample 4: Move a file to a new location.\n\nUser Query: Move the 'example.txt' file to the '/path/to/new/directory' directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `move_it('/path/to/example.txt', '/path/to/new/directory')` to move the file.\n\nBy following these examples and using the provided functions, you should be able to answer user queries and perform various tasks in this functional environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Each function has its own set of arguments and return types, which are documented in the function descriptors.\n\nWhen calling functions, make sure to pass the correct argument types and number of arguments. Some functions may throw exceptions if the arguments are invalid or if the operation fails.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can use the functions to perform tasks such as creating files and directories, listing directory contents, searching for patterns in files, modifying file permissions, moving files and directories, and writing content to files.\n\nWhen interacting with the environment, keep in mind the following:\n\n* File paths should be absolute and start with a forward slash (/).\n* Directory paths should end with a forward slash (/).\n* File and directory names should not contain spaces or special characters.\n* Permission modes should be in the format of 'rwxr-xr-x' or '755'.\n* Pattern searching is case-sensitive.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the provided functions, you should be able to navigate this functional environment and answer user queries effectively.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it.\n\nUser Query: Create a new file called 'example.txt' and write 'Hello, world!' to it.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/example.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n2. Call `write_next('/path/to/example.txt', 'Hello, world!')` to write the content.\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory.\n\nUser Query: List the contents of the '/path/to/directory' directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the contents.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\nUser Query: Search for the pattern 'example' in the 'example.txt' file.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `match_it('example', '/path/to/example.txt')` to search for the pattern.\n\nExample 4: Move a file to a new location.\n\nUser Query: Move the 'example.txt' file to the '/path/to/new/directory' directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `move_it('/path/to/example.txt', '/path/to/new/directory')` to move the file.\n\nBy following these examples and using the provided functions, you should be able to answer user queries and perform various tasks in this functional environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

   "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. The query is to delete a directory called 'tempdir'\n2. The appropriate function for deleting files or directories is `destory()`\n3. Since it's a directory, we'll use the `recursive` parameter to ensure all contents are removed\n4. We'll also use `force` to ensure deletion even if there are any permission issues\n\nHere's the function call:\n\n<function_list>\ndestory('/tempdir', recursive=True, force=True)\n</function_list>\n\nThe function call uses:\n- Path: '/tempdir' (assuming the directory is in the root directory)\n- `recursive=True` to remove all contents of the directory\n- `force=True` to force deletion if there are any permission or access issues\n\nThis should completely remove the 'tempdir' directory and all its contents.",
   "The function call resulted in a \"Permission denied\" error, which means we cannot delete the directory with the current permissions. \n\nTo resolve this, we might need to modify the permissions first.

   "The output indicates two issues:\n\n1. The `mod_perms()` function requires a 9-character permission mode, not just '777'\n2.

Call `move_it('/path/to/example.txt', '/path/to/new/directory')` to move the file.\n\nBy following these examples and using the provided functions, you should be able to answer user queries and perform various tasks in this functional environment.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
