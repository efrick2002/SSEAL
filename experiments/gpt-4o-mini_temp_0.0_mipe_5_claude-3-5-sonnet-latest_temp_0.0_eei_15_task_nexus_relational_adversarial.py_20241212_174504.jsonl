Data Structure:\n- Users: 6 users with IDs (1,21,35,41,42,43)\n- Locations: 5 locations with IDs (1-5)\n- Foods: 7 food items with IDs (1-7)\n\n2. Function Parameter Handling:\n- Sort parameters are case-insensitive\n- Supports underscores, hyphens, dots for compound parameters\n- Whitespace is trimmed\n- Invalid parameters default to standard sorting\n\n3. Testing Strategy:\n- Start with basic ID validation\n- Test sort parameters systematically\n- Verify edge cases (invalid IDs, empty strings)\n- Test compound parameters in various formats\n\n4. Error Handling:\n- Clear error messages for invalid IDs\n- Type mismatch errors for incorrect parameter types\n- Consistent error format across functions\n\n5. Best Practices:\n- Always verify ID ranges before calls\n- Test new sort parameters with both c() and z()\n- Check both abbreviated and full parameter names\n- Verify case sensitivity for new parameters\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What food allergies should Alice be aware of?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Alice's user ID (known: 1)\n2. Get all food items and their details\n```python\nh(1)  # Get Pizza details\nh(2)  # Get Chocolate details\n# ... continue for all food IDs\n```\n3. Compile allergen list from results\n\nExample 2: \"What's the current weather in Charlie's location?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Charlie's user ID (35)\n2. Use z(\"location\") to see location assignments\n3. Find Charlie's location\n4. Use q() to get weather:\n```python\nz(\"location\")  # Find Charlie's location\nq(3)  # Get weather for location\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Sort all foods by temperature, from hottest to coldest\"\nSteps:\n1. Use c() with temperature parameter:\n```python\nc(\"hot\")  # Gets foods sorted by temperature\n```\n2. Results will be ordered from hottest to coldest\n\nThese examples demonstrate the systematic approach needed: identify relevant IDs, use appropriate sort parameters, and chain function calls to get desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Best Practices:\n- Always verify ID ranges before calls\n- Test new sort parameters with both c() and z()\n- Check both abbreviated and full parameter names\n- Verify case sensitivity for new parameters\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What food allergies should Alice be aware of?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Alice's user ID (known: 1)\n2. Get all food items and their details\n```python\nh(1)  # Get Pizza details\nh(2)  # Get Chocolate details\n# ... continue for all food IDs\n```\n3. Compile allergen list from results\n\nExample 2: \"What's the current weather in Charlie's location?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Charlie's user ID (35)\n2. Use z(\"location\") to see location assignments\n3. Find Charlie's location\n4. Use q() to get weather:\n```python\nz(\"location\")  # Find Charlie's location\nq(3)  # Get weather for location\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Sort all foods by temperature, from hottest to coldest\"\nSteps:\n1. Use c() with temperature parameter:\n```python\nc(\"hot\")  # Gets foods sorted by temperature\n```\n2. Results will be ordered from hottest to coldest\n\nThese examples demonstrate the systematic approach needed: identify relevant IDs, use appropriate sort parameters, and chain function calls to get desired information.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Testing Strategy:\n- Start with basic ID validation\n- Test sort parameters systematically\n- Verify edge cases (invalid IDs, empty strings)\n- Test compound parameters in various formats\n\n4. Error Handling:\n- Clear error messages for invalid IDs\n- Type mismatch errors for incorrect parameter types\n- Consistent error format across functions\n\n5. Best Practices:\n- Always verify ID ranges before calls\n- Test new sort parameters with both c() and z()\n- Check both abbreviated and full parameter names\n- Verify case sensitivity for new parameters\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What food allergies should Alice be aware of?\"\nSteps:\n1.
