User System:\n- 6 users (IDs: 1,21,35,41,42,43)\n- Each user has name, email, color preference, and numeric preferences\n- Current user is always 35\n\n2. Location System:\n- 5 cities (IDs: 1-5)\n- Each location has city name, current time, weather\n\n3. Food System:\n- 7 food items (IDs: 1-7)\n- Each food has name, calories, allergens\n\nOperating Guidelines:\n1. Always validate IDs before use:\n- Use k() to get valid user IDs\n- Use x() to get valid location IDs\n- Use c() to get valid food IDs\n\n2. Error Handling:\n- Most functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Check return types to handle errors appropriately\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n- Some functions return ordered lists that may vary\n- Core data (IDs, names, etc.) remains consistent\n\n4. Function Selection:\n- Use detailed functions (g,h) for complete information\n- Use specific functions (t,w) for single data points\n- Use list functions (z,x,c) for browsing data\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the weather like where Alice lives?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Alice's ID: z(\"\") -> Find ID 1\n2. Get Alice's preferences: m(1) -> [1,2,3] (location preference might be 1)\n3. Get weather: q(1) -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"List all foods Charlie is allergic to\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Charlie's ID: j(35) confirms it's Charlie\n2. Get all foods: c(\"\") -> list of all foods\n3. Check each food's allergens using h():\n   for food_id in range(1,8):\n       allergies = h(food_id)['allergic_ingredients']\n       # Check allergies\n\nExample 3: \"What time is it in Eve's city?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Eve's ID: k() -> includes 42\n2. Get Eve's preferences: m(42) -> [5,7,4] (location preference might be 5)\n3. Get time: e(5) -> \"2023-11-14 1:20 PM\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

User System:\n- 6 users (IDs: 1,21,35,41,42,43)\n- Each user has name, email, color preference, and numeric preferences\n- Current user is always 35\n\n2. Location System:\n- 5 cities (IDs: 1-5)\n- Each location has city name, current time, weather\n\n3. Food System:\n- 7 food items (IDs: 1-7)\n- Each food has name, calories, allergens\n\nOperating Guidelines:\n1. Always validate IDs before use:\n- Use k() to get valid user IDs\n- Use x() to get valid location IDs\n- Use c() to get valid food IDs\n\n2. Error Handling:\n- Most functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Check return types to handle errors appropriately\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n- Some functions return ordered lists that may vary\n- Core data (IDs, names, etc.) remains consistent\n\n4. Function Selection:\n- Use detailed functions (g,h) for complete information\n- Use specific functions (t,w) for single data points\n- Use list functions (z,x,c) for browsing data\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the weather like where Alice lives?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Alice's ID: z(\"\") -> Find ID 1\n2. Get Alice's preferences: m(1) -> [1,2,3] (location preference might be 1)\n3. Get weather: q(1) -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"List all foods Charlie is allergic to\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Charlie's ID: j(35) confirms it's Charlie\n2. Get all foods: c(\"\") -> list of all foods\n3. Check each food's allergens using h():\n   for food_id in range(1,8):\n       allergies = h(food_id)['allergic_ingredients']\n       # Check allergies\n\nExample 3: \"What time is it in Eve's city?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Eve's ID: k() -> includes 42\n2. Get Eve's preferences: m(42) -> [5,7,4] (location preference might be 5)\n3. Get time: e(5) -> \"2023-11-14 1:20 PM\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

User System:\n- 6 users (IDs: 1,21,35,41,42,43)\n- Each user has name, email, color preference, and numeric preferences\n- Current user is always 35\n\n2. Location System:\n- 5 cities (IDs: 1-5)\n- Each location has city name, current time, weather\n\n3. Food System:\n- 7 food items (IDs: 1-7)\n- Each food has name, calories, allergens\n\nOperating Guidelines:\n1. Always validate IDs before use:\n- Use k() to get valid user IDs\n- Use x() to get valid location IDs\n- Use c() to get valid food IDs\n\n2. Error Handling:\n- Most functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Check return types to handle errors appropriately\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n- Some functions return ordered lists that may vary\n- Core data (IDs, names, etc.) remains consistent\n\n4. Function Selection:\n- Use detailed functions (g,h) for complete information\n- Use specific functions (t,w) for single data points\n- Use list functions (z,x,c) for browsing data\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the weather like where Alice lives?\"\nSteps:\n1.

Get weather: q(1) -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"List all foods Charlie is allergic to\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Charlie's ID: j(35) confirms it's Charlie\n2. Get all foods: c(\"\") -> list of all foods\n3. Check each food's allergens using h():\n   for food_id in range(1,8):\n       allergies = h(food_id)['allergic_ingredients']\n       # Check allergies\n\nExample 3: \"What time is it in Eve's city?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Eve's ID: k() -> includes 42\n2. Get Eve's preferences: m(42) -> [5,7,4] (location preference might be 5)\n3. Get time: e(5) -> \"2023-11-14 1:20 PM\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Location System:\n- 5 cities (IDs: 1-5)\n- Each location has city name, current time, weather\n\n3. Food System:\n- 7 food items (IDs: 1-7)\n- Each food has name, calories, allergens\n\nOperating Guidelines:\n1. Always validate IDs before use:\n- Use k() to get valid user IDs\n- Use x() to get valid location IDs\n- Use c() to get valid food IDs\n\n2. Error Handling:\n- Most functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Check return types to handle errors appropriately\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n- Some functions return ordered lists that may vary\n- Core data (IDs, names, etc.) remains consistent\n\n4. Function Selection:\n- Use detailed functions (g,h) for complete information\n- Use specific functions (t,w) for single data points\n- Use list functions (z,x,c) for browsing data\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the weather like where Alice lives?\"\nSteps:\n1.

Get weather: q(1) -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"List all foods Charlie is allergic to\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Charlie's ID: j(35) confirms it's Charlie\n2. Get all foods: c(\"\") -> list of all foods\n3. Check each food's allergens using h():\n   for food_id in range(1,8):\n       allergies = h(food_id)['allergic_ingredients']\n       # Check allergies\n\nExample 3: \"What time is it in Eve's city?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Eve's ID: k() -> includes 42\n2. Get Eve's preferences: m(42) -> [5,7,4] (location preference might be 5)\n3. Get time: e(5) -> \"2023-11-14 1:20 PM\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

User System:\n- 6 users (IDs: 1,21,35,41,42,43)\n- Each user has name, email, color preference, and numeric preferences\n- Current user is always 35\n\n2. Location System:\n- 5 cities (IDs: 1-5)\n- Each location has city name, current time, weather\n\n3. Food System:\n- 7 food items (IDs: 1-7)\n- Each food has name, calories, allergens\n\nOperating Guidelines:\n1. Always validate IDs before use:\n- Use k() to get valid user IDs\n- Use x() to get valid location IDs\n- Use c() to get valid food IDs\n\n2. Error Handling:\n- Most functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Check return types to handle errors appropriately\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n- Some functions return ordered lists that may vary\n- Core data (IDs, names, etc.) remains consistent\n\n4. Function Selection:\n- Use detailed functions (g,h) for complete information\n- Use specific functions (t,w) for single data points\n- Use list functions (z,x,c) for browsing data\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the weather like where Alice lives?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Alice's ID: z(\"\") -> Find ID 1\n2. Get Alice's preferences: m(1) -> [1,2,3] (location preference might be 1)\n3. Get weather: q(1) -> \"Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F\"\n\nExample 2: \"List all foods Charlie is allergic to\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Charlie's ID: j(35) confirms it's Charlie\n2. Get all foods: c(\"\") -> list of all foods\n3. Check each food's allergens using h():\n   for food_id in range(1,8):\n       allergies = h(food_id)['allergic_ingredients']\n       # Check allergies\n\nExample 3: \"What time is it in Eve's city?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Eve's ID: k() -> includes 42\n2. Get Eve's preferences: m(42) -> [5,7,4] (location preference might be 5)\n3. Get time: e(5) -> \"2023-11-14 1:20 PM\"\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Food System:\n- 7 food items (IDs: 1-7)\n- Each food has name, calories, allergens\n\nOperating Guidelines:\n1. Always validate IDs before use:\n- Use k() to get valid user IDs\n- Use x() to get valid location IDs\n- Use c() to get valid food IDs\n\n2. Error Handling:\n- Most functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Check return types to handle errors appropriately\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n- Some functions return ordered lists that may vary\n- Core data (IDs, names, etc.) remains consistent\n\n4.

Food System:\n- 7 food items (IDs: 1-7)\n- Each food has name, calories, allergens\n\nOperating Guidelines:\n1. Always validate IDs before use:\n- Use k() to get valid user IDs\n- Use x() to get valid location IDs\n- Use c() to get valid food IDs\n\n2. Error Handling:\n- Most functions return error strings for invalid IDs\n- Check return types to handle errors appropriately\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n- Some functions return ordered lists that may vary\n- Core data (IDs, names, etc.) remains consistent\n\n4.

Check each food's allergens using h():\n   for food_id in range(1,8):\n       allergies = h(food_id)['allergic_ingredients']\n       # Check allergies\n\nExample 3: \"What time is it in Eve's city?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Eve's ID: k() -> includes 42\n2. Get Eve's preferences: m(42) -> [5,7,4] (location preference might be 5)\n3.
