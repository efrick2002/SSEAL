</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

</functions>\n\n        Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \n1. Function Behavior:\n   - The 'find_by_name' functions (find_foods_by_name, find_users_by_name, find_locations_by_name) return all items regardless of the input. They do not filter results.\n   - get_current_user_id() returns a static value (35) in the current implementation.\n   - All other functions behave as expected, returning specific information based on the provided ID.\n\n2. Error Handling:\n   - Most functions will likely raise a ValueError if an invalid ID is provided, although this wasn't explicitly tested.\n\n3. Data Consistency:\n   - User IDs, food IDs, and location IDs appear to be consistent across different function calls.\n\n4. Time and Weather:\n   - Time and weather information is location-specific and appears to be dynamic.\n\n5. Answering User Queries:\n   - To answer user queries, first identify the type of information needed (user, food, or location).\n   - Use the appropriate 'get_info' function to retrieve detailed information about an entity if you have its ID.\n   - If you need to find an entity by name, use the appropriate 'find_by_name' function, but remember it will return all entities. You may need to filter the results programmatically.\n   - For specific attributes (like email, favorite color, etc.), use the dedicated functions if available.\n   - Chain function calls as needed. For example, to get a user's current weather, first get their location ID, then use that to get the weather.\n\n6. Function Calling Process:\n   - Always wrap function calls in the <function_list> tags.\n   - You can make multiple function calls in a single interaction.\n   - Analyze the returned results carefully to determine if additional function calls are needed.\n\n7. Data Limitations:\n   - The system appears to have a limited set of users, foods, and locations. Be aware that not all queries may return results.\n\n8. Performance Considerations:\n   - Minimize the number of function calls by using the most specific functions available for your needs.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What's the current weather for Alice?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's location ID\n<function_list>\nget_user_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 1\n\nStep 3: Get the weather for Alice's location\n<function_list>\nget_weather_at_location(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: 'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'\n\nAnswer: The current weather for Alice is Partly Cloudy with a temperature of 68\u00b0F.\n\nExample 2: \"What are Bob's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Bob's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Bob\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 21, 'name': 'Bob'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Bob's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(21)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [4, 5, 6]\n\nStep 3: Get the names of these foods\n<function_list>\nget_food_name(4)\nget_food_name(5)\nget_food_name(6)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n'Burger'\n'Ice Cream'\n'Pasta'\n\nAnswer: Bob's favorite foods are Burger, Ice Cream, and Pasta.\n\nExample 3: \"How many calories are in Alice's favorite foods?\"\n\nStep 1: Get Alice's user ID\n<function_list>\nfind_users_by_name(\"Alice\")\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]\n\nStep 2: Get Alice's favorite food IDs\n<function_list>\nget_user_favorite_foods(1)\n</function_list>\n\nResult: [1, 2, 3]\n\nStep 3: Get the calories for each food\n<function_list>\nget_food_calories(1)\nget_food_calories(2)\nget_food_calories(3)\n</function_list>\n\nResults:\n285\n50\n200 (assumed value for illustration)\n\nStep 4: Sum the calories\nTotal calories = 285 + 50 + 200 = 535\n\nAnswer: The total calories in Alice's favorite foods is 535.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
