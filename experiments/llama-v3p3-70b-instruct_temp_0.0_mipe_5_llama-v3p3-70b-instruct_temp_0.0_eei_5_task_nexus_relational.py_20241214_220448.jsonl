Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Here is additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo interact with this environment, you can use the provided functions to retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather. The functions can be used in combination to answer complex queries.\n\nHere are some general tips for using the environment:\n\n* Use the `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions to search for users, locations, and foods by name.\n* Use the `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions to retrieve detailed information about users, locations, and foods.\n* Use the `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions to retrieve specific information about users.\n* Use the `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions to retrieve weather and time information for locations.\n* Use the `list_user_ids` function to retrieve a list of all user IDs.\n\nWhen using the environment, be aware of the following:\n\n* The `find_users_by_name`, `find_locations_by_name`, and `find_foods_by_name` functions return lists of matching results, but the match is not exact. They seem to return results that contain the given name as a substring.\n* The `get_user_info`, `get_location_info`, and `get_food_info` functions return dictionaries containing detailed information about the user, location, or food.\n* The `get_user_email`, `get_user_favorite_color`, and `get_user_favorite_foods` functions return specific information about the user.\n* The `get_weather_at_location` and `get_current_time_for_location` functions return strings containing the current weather and time for the location.\n* The `list_user_ids` function returns a list of all user IDs.\n\nBy following these tips and being aware of the environment's behavior, you can effectively use the environment to answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nHere are a few examples of how to use the environment to answer complex queries:\n\nExample 1: Find the favorite foods of a user with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_users_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching user IDs.\n2. Call `get_user_info` with the user ID to retrieve the user's information.\n3. Call `get_user_favorite_foods` with the user ID to retrieve the user's favorite foods.\n\nExample 2: Find the current weather at a location with a given city name.\n\n1. Call `find_locations_by_name` with the given city name to retrieve a list of matching location IDs.\n2. Call `get_location_info` with the location ID to retrieve the location's information.\n3. Call `get_weather_at_location` with the location ID to retrieve the current weather.\n\nExample 3: Find the calories per serving of a food with a given name.\n\n1. Call `find_foods_by_name` with the given name to retrieve a list of matching food IDs.\n2. Call `get_food_info` with the food ID to retrieve the food's information.\n3. Call `get_food_calories` with the food ID to retrieve the calories per serving.\n\nBy following these examples and using the environment's functions in combination, you can answer complex queries and retrieve information about users, locations, foods, and weather.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
