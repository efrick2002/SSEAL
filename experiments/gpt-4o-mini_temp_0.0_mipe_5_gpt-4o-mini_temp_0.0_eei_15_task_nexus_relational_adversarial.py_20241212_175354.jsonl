regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Many functions return error messages when the input cannot be resolved. It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Many functions return error messages when the input cannot be resolved. It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Many functions return error messages when the input cannot be resolved. It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Many functions return error messages when the input cannot be resolved. It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Many functions return error messages when the input cannot be resolved. It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Many functions return error messages when the input cannot be resolved. It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Many functions return error messages when the input cannot be resolved. It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs.

regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo effectively interact with this environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Many functions return error messages when the input cannot be resolved. It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Outputs**: Many functions return error messages when the input cannot be resolved. It's important to test various inputs to understand the valid range of IDs or names.\n\n2. **Input Types**: Ensure that the correct data types are used for function arguments. For example, user IDs and food IDs should be integers, while food names should be strings.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing**: If a function returns an error, try incrementing the ID or changing the input to see if a valid response can be obtained. This can help identify valid ranges for user IDs and location IDs.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Each function has been documented with examples. Use these examples as a reference for expected inputs and outputs.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle error messages gracefully. If a function consistently returns an error for a range of inputs, it may indicate that the IDs are not valid or that the function is not designed to handle those inputs.\n\n6. **Exploration**: If you are unsure about the behavior of a function, consider calling it with a variety of inputs to observe the outputs. This can help clarify its functionality.\n\n7. **Combining Functions**: Some tasks may require the use of multiple functions in sequence. Plan your function calls to build upon the results of previous calls.\n\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
