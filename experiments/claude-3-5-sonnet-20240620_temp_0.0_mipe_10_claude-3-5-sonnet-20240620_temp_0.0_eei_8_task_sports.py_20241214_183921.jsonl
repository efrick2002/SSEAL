Table Names: Always use the full table name including the '.tbl' extension when using the read_db() function.\n\n2. Function Chaining: Use the execute_operations() function to chain multiple operations together. This is particularly useful for complex queries.\n\n3. Aggregations: The aggregate() function supports basic operations like 'sum', 'mean', 'max', and 'min'. It does not support lambda functions or custom aggregations.\n\n4. Calculations: The calculate_column() function supports basic arithmetic operations but does not support complex operations like case statements.\n\n5. Conditions: When using the select() function, complex conditions (like OR conditions) are not supported. Use multiple select operations or the execute_operations() function for more complex queries.\n\n6. Joins: The merge_tables() function supports inner, outer, left, and right joins. Be mindful of the order of DataFrames for left and right joins.\n\n7. Error Handling: Many functions will raise KeyErrors if the specified table or column does not exist. Always check for the existence of tables and columns before operations.\n\n8. Metadata: Use the get_metadata() and ls() functions to understand the structure of the database before performing operations.\n\n9. Limitations: Be aware of the limitations of each function. For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4. Use select(), sort(), and limit() for basic data retrieval and filtering.\n5. Use merge_tables() if data from multiple tables is required.\n6. Use aggregate() for summary statistics.\n7. Use calculate_column() for any necessary calculations.\n8. If multiple steps are required, consider using execute_operations() to chain them together.\n9. Always check the output of each step to ensure it's producing the expected results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 years old?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the player table\nread_db('player.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use execute_operations to chain the necessary operations\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['name', 'age', 'salary'], 'conditions': {'age': ('>', 30)}}},\n    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n    {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n])\n\nExample 2: \"What is the average annual budget for teams with more than 5 championships?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the teams table\nread_db('teams.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use select to filter teams with more than 5 championships\nselect(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)})\n\nStep 3: Use aggregate to calculate the average annual budget\naggregate(select(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)}), group_by=None, agg_dict={'annual_budget': 'mean'})\n\nExample 3: \"Who are the coaches of teams with a win percentage above 60%?\"\n\nStep 1: Calculate win percentage for each team\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n])\n\nStep 2: Merge the result with the teams and coach tables\nmerge_tables(\n    merge_tables(\n        execute_operations([\n            {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n            {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n            {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n        ]),\n        read_db('teams.tbl'),\n        on='team_id'\n    ),\n    read_db('coach.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down complex queries into steps, use multiple functions in combination, and leverage the execute_operations function for multi-step operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Table Names: Always use the full table name including the '.tbl' extension when using the read_db() function.\n\n2. Function Chaining: Use the execute_operations() function to chain multiple operations together. This is particularly useful for complex queries.\n\n3. Aggregations: The aggregate() function supports basic operations like 'sum', 'mean', 'max', and 'min'. It does not support lambda functions or custom aggregations.\n\n4. Calculations: The calculate_column() function supports basic arithmetic operations but does not support complex operations like case statements.\n\n5. Conditions: When using the select() function, complex conditions (like OR conditions) are not supported. Use multiple select operations or the execute_operations() function for more complex queries.\n\n6. Joins: The merge_tables() function supports inner, outer, left, and right joins. Be mindful of the order of DataFrames for left and right joins.\n\n7. Error Handling: Many functions will raise KeyErrors if the specified table or column does not exist. Always check for the existence of tables and columns before operations.\n\n8. Metadata: Use the get_metadata() and ls() functions to understand the structure of the database before performing operations.\n\n9. Limitations: Be aware of the limitations of each function. For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4. Use select(), sort(), and limit() for basic data retrieval and filtering.\n5. Use merge_tables() if data from multiple tables is required.\n6. Use aggregate() for summary statistics.\n7. Use calculate_column() for any necessary calculations.\n8. If multiple steps are required, consider using execute_operations() to chain them together.\n9. Always check the output of each step to ensure it's producing the expected results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 years old?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the player table\nread_db('player.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use execute_operations to chain the necessary operations\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['name', 'age', 'salary'], 'conditions': {'age': ('>', 30)}}},\n    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n    {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n])\n\nExample 2: \"What is the average annual budget for teams with more than 5 championships?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the teams table\nread_db('teams.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use select to filter teams with more than 5 championships\nselect(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)})\n\nStep 3: Use aggregate to calculate the average annual budget\naggregate(select(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)}), group_by=None, agg_dict={'annual_budget': 'mean'})\n\nExample 3: \"Who are the coaches of teams with a win percentage above 60%?\"\n\nStep 1: Calculate win percentage for each team\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n])\n\nStep 2: Merge the result with the teams and coach tables\nmerge_tables(\n    merge_tables(\n        execute_operations([\n            {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n            {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n            {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n        ]),\n        read_db('teams.tbl'),\n        on='team_id'\n    ),\n    read_db('coach.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down complex queries into steps, use multiple functions in combination, and leverage the execute_operations function for multi-step operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4. Use select(), sort(), and limit() for basic data retrieval and filtering.\n5. Use merge_tables() if data from multiple tables is required.\n6. Use aggregate() for summary statistics.\n7. Use calculate_column() for any necessary calculations.\n8. If multiple steps are required, consider using execute_operations() to chain them together.\n9. Always check the output of each step to ensure it's producing the expected results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 years old?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the player table\nread_db('player.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use execute_operations to chain the necessary operations\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['name', 'age', 'salary'], 'conditions': {'age': ('>', 30)}}},\n    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n    {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n])\n\nExample 2: \"What is the average annual budget for teams with more than 5 championships?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the teams table\nread_db('teams.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use select to filter teams with more than 5 championships\nselect(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)})\n\nStep 3: Use aggregate to calculate the average annual budget\naggregate(select(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)}), group_by=None, agg_dict={'annual_budget': 'mean'})\n\nExample 3: \"Who are the coaches of teams with a win percentage above 60%?\"\n\nStep 1: Calculate win percentage for each team\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n])\n\nStep 2: Merge the result with the teams and coach tables\nmerge_tables(\n    merge_tables(\n        execute_operations([\n            {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n            {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n            {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n        ]),\n        read_db('teams.tbl'),\n        on='team_id'\n    ),\n    read_db('coach.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down complex queries into steps, use multiple functions in combination, and leverage the execute_operations function for multi-step operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Table Names: Always use the full table name including the '.tbl' extension when using the read_db() function.\n\n2. Function Chaining: Use the execute_operations() function to chain multiple operations together. This is particularly useful for complex queries.\n\n3. Aggregations: The aggregate() function supports basic operations like 'sum', 'mean', 'max', and 'min'. It does not support lambda functions or custom aggregations.\n\n4. Calculations: The calculate_column() function supports basic arithmetic operations but does not support complex operations like case statements.\n\n5. Conditions: When using the select() function, complex conditions (like OR conditions) are not supported. Use multiple select operations or the execute_operations() function for more complex queries.\n\n6. Joins: The merge_tables() function supports inner, outer, left, and right joins. Be mindful of the order of DataFrames for left and right joins.\n\n7. Error Handling: Many functions will raise KeyErrors if the specified table or column does not exist. Always check for the existence of tables and columns before operations.\n\n8. Metadata: Use the get_metadata() and ls() functions to understand the structure of the database before performing operations.\n\n9. Limitations: Be aware of the limitations of each function. For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4.

Table Names: Always use the full table name including the '.tbl' extension when using the read_db() function.\n\n2. Function Chaining: Use the execute_operations() function to chain multiple operations together. This is particularly useful for complex queries.\n\n3. Aggregations: The aggregate() function supports basic operations like 'sum', 'mean', 'max', and 'min'. It does not support lambda functions or custom aggregations.\n\n4. Calculations: The calculate_column() function supports basic arithmetic operations but does not support complex operations like case statements.\n\n5. Conditions: When using the select() function, complex conditions (like OR conditions) are not supported. Use multiple select operations or the execute_operations() function for more complex queries.\n\n6. Joins: The merge_tables() function supports inner, outer, left, and right joins. Be mindful of the order of DataFrames for left and right joins.\n\n7. Error Handling: Many functions will raise KeyErrors if the specified table or column does not exist. Always check for the existence of tables and columns before operations.\n\n8. Metadata: Use the get_metadata() and ls() functions to understand the structure of the database before performing operations.\n\n9. Limitations: Be aware of the limitations of each function. For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4. Use select(), sort(), and limit() for basic data retrieval and filtering.\n5. Use merge_tables() if data from multiple tables is required.\n6. Use aggregate() for summary statistics.\n7. Use calculate_column() for any necessary calculations.\n8. If multiple steps are required, consider using execute_operations() to chain them together.\n9. Always check the output of each step to ensure it's producing the expected results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 years old?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the player table\nread_db('player.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use execute_operations to chain the necessary operations\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['name', 'age', 'salary'], 'conditions': {'age': ('>', 30)}}},\n    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n    {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n])\n\nExample 2: \"What is the average annual budget for teams with more than 5 championships?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the teams table\nread_db('teams.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use select to filter teams with more than 5 championships\nselect(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)})\n\nStep 3: Use aggregate to calculate the average annual budget\naggregate(select(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)}), group_by=None, agg_dict={'annual_budget': 'mean'})\n\nExample 3: \"Who are the coaches of teams with a win percentage above 60%?\"\n\nStep 1: Calculate win percentage for each team\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n])\n\nStep 2: Merge the result with the teams and coach tables\nmerge_tables(\n    merge_tables(\n        execute_operations([\n            {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n            {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n            {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n        ]),\n        read_db('teams.tbl'),\n        on='team_id'\n    ),\n    read_db('coach.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down complex queries into steps, use multiple functions in combination, and leverage the execute_operations function for multi-step operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Table Names: Always use the full table name including the '.tbl' extension when using the read_db() function.\n\n2. Function Chaining: Use the execute_operations() function to chain multiple operations together. This is particularly useful for complex queries.\n\n3. Aggregations: The aggregate() function supports basic operations like 'sum', 'mean', 'max', and 'min'. It does not support lambda functions or custom aggregations.\n\n4. Calculations: The calculate_column() function supports basic arithmetic operations but does not support complex operations like case statements.\n\n5. Conditions: When using the select() function, complex conditions (like OR conditions) are not supported. Use multiple select operations or the execute_operations() function for more complex queries.\n\n6. Joins: The merge_tables() function supports inner, outer, left, and right joins. Be mindful of the order of DataFrames for left and right joins.\n\n7. Error Handling: Many functions will raise KeyErrors if the specified table or column does not exist. Always check for the existence of tables and columns before operations.\n\n8. Metadata: Use the get_metadata() and ls() functions to understand the structure of the database before performing operations.\n\n9. Limitations: Be aware of the limitations of each function. For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4. Use select(), sort(), and limit() for basic data retrieval and filtering.\n5. Use merge_tables() if data from multiple tables is required.\n6. Use aggregate() for summary statistics.\n7. Use calculate_column() for any necessary calculations.\n8. If multiple steps are required, consider using execute_operations() to chain them together.\n9. Always check the output of each step to ensure it's producing the expected results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 years old?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the player table\nread_db('player.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use execute_operations to chain the necessary operations\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['name', 'age', 'salary'], 'conditions': {'age': ('>', 30)}}},\n    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n    {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n])\n\nExample 2: \"What is the average annual budget for teams with more than 5 championships?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the teams table\nread_db('teams.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use select to filter teams with more than 5 championships\nselect(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)})\n\nStep 3: Use aggregate to calculate the average annual budget\naggregate(select(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)}), group_by=None, agg_dict={'annual_budget': 'mean'})\n\nExample 3: \"Who are the coaches of teams with a win percentage above 60%?\"\n\nStep 1: Calculate win percentage for each team\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n])\n\nStep 2: Merge the result with the teams and coach tables\nmerge_tables(\n    merge_tables(\n        execute_operations([\n            {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n            {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n            {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n        ]),\n        read_db('teams.tbl'),\n        on='team_id'\n    ),\n    read_db('coach.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down complex queries into steps, use multiple functions in combination, and leverage the execute_operations function for multi-step operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Table Names: Always use the full table name including the '.tbl' extension when using the read_db() function.\n\n2. Function Chaining: Use the execute_operations() function to chain multiple operations together. This is particularly useful for complex queries.\n\n3. Aggregations: The aggregate() function supports basic operations like 'sum', 'mean', 'max', and 'min'. It does not support lambda functions or custom aggregations.\n\n4. Calculations: The calculate_column() function supports basic arithmetic operations but does not support complex operations like case statements.\n\n5. Conditions: When using the select() function, complex conditions (like OR conditions) are not supported. Use multiple select operations or the execute_operations() function for more complex queries.\n\n6. Joins: The merge_tables() function supports inner, outer, left, and right joins. Be mindful of the order of DataFrames for left and right joins.\n\n7. Error Handling: Many functions will raise KeyErrors if the specified table or column does not exist. Always check for the existence of tables and columns before operations.\n\n8. Metadata: Use the get_metadata() and ls() functions to understand the structure of the database before performing operations.\n\n9. Limitations: Be aware of the limitations of each function. For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4. Use select(), sort(), and limit() for basic data retrieval and filtering.\n5. Use merge_tables() if data from multiple tables is required.\n6. Use aggregate() for summary statistics.\n7. Use calculate_column() for any necessary calculations.\n8. If multiple steps are required, consider using execute_operations() to chain them together.\n9. Always check the output of each step to ensure it's producing the expected results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 years old?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the player table\nread_db('player.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use execute_operations to chain the necessary operations\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['name', 'age', 'salary'], 'conditions': {'age': ('>', 30)}}},\n    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n    {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n])\n\nExample 2: \"What is the average annual budget for teams with more than 5 championships?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the teams table\nread_db('teams.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use select to filter teams with more than 5 championships\nselect(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)})\n\nStep 3: Use aggregate to calculate the average annual budget\naggregate(select(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)}), group_by=None, agg_dict={'annual_budget': 'mean'})\n\nExample 3: \"Who are the coaches of teams with a win percentage above 60%?\"\n\nStep 1: Calculate win percentage for each team\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n])\n\nStep 2: Merge the result with the teams and coach tables\nmerge_tables(\n    merge_tables(\n        execute_operations([\n            {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n            {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n            {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n        ]),\n        read_db('teams.tbl'),\n        on='team_id'\n    ),\n    read_db('coach.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down complex queries into steps, use multiple functions in combination, and leverage the execute_operations function for multi-step operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Table Names: Always use the full table name including the '.tbl' extension when using the read_db() function.\n\n2. Function Chaining: Use the execute_operations() function to chain multiple operations together. This is particularly useful for complex queries.\n\n3. Aggregations: The aggregate() function supports basic operations like 'sum', 'mean', 'max', and 'min'. It does not support lambda functions or custom aggregations.\n\n4. Calculations: The calculate_column() function supports basic arithmetic operations but does not support complex operations like case statements.\n\n5. Conditions: When using the select() function, complex conditions (like OR conditions) are not supported. Use multiple select operations or the execute_operations() function for more complex queries.\n\n6. Joins: The merge_tables() function supports inner, outer, left, and right joins. Be mindful of the order of DataFrames for left and right joins.\n\n7. Error Handling: Many functions will raise KeyErrors if the specified table or column does not exist. Always check for the existence of tables and columns before operations.\n\n8. Metadata: Use the get_metadata() and ls() functions to understand the structure of the database before performing operations.\n\n9. Limitations: Be aware of the limitations of each function. For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4. Use select(), sort(), and limit() for basic data retrieval and filtering.\n5. Use merge_tables() if data from multiple tables is required.\n6. Use aggregate() for summary statistics.\n7. Use calculate_column() for any necessary calculations.\n8. If multiple steps are required, consider using execute_operations() to chain them together.\n9. Always check the output of each step to ensure it's producing the expected results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 years old?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the player table\nread_db('player.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use execute_operations to chain the necessary operations\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['name', 'age', 'salary'], 'conditions': {'age': ('>', 30)}}},\n    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n    {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n])\n\nExample 2: \"What is the average annual budget for teams with more than 5 championships?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the teams table\nread_db('teams.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use select to filter teams with more than 5 championships\nselect(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)})\n\nStep 3: Use aggregate to calculate the average annual budget\naggregate(select(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)}), group_by=None, agg_dict={'annual_budget': 'mean'})\n\nExample 3: \"Who are the coaches of teams with a win percentage above 60%?\"\n\nStep 1: Calculate win percentage for each team\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n])\n\nStep 2: Merge the result with the teams and coach tables\nmerge_tables(\n    merge_tables(\n        execute_operations([\n            {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n            {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n            {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n        ]),\n        read_db('teams.tbl'),\n        on='team_id'\n    ),\n    read_db('coach.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down complex queries into steps, use multiple functions in combination, and leverage the execute_operations function for multi-step operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4. Use select(), sort(), and limit() for basic data retrieval and filtering.\n5. Use merge_tables() if data from multiple tables is required.\n6. Use aggregate() for summary statistics.\n7.

Table Names: Always use the full table name including the '.tbl' extension when using the read_db() function.\n\n2. Function Chaining: Use the execute_operations() function to chain multiple operations together. This is particularly useful for complex queries.\n\n3. Aggregations: The aggregate() function supports basic operations like 'sum', 'mean', 'max', and 'min'. It does not support lambda functions or custom aggregations.\n\n4. Calculations: The calculate_column() function supports basic arithmetic operations but does not support complex operations like case statements.\n\n5. Conditions: When using the select() function, complex conditions (like OR conditions) are not supported. Use multiple select operations or the execute_operations() function for more complex queries.\n\n6. Joins: The merge_tables() function supports inner, outer, left, and right joins. Be mindful of the order of DataFrames for left and right joins.\n\n7. Error Handling: Many functions will raise KeyErrors if the specified table or column does not exist. Always check for the existence of tables and columns before operations.\n\n8. Metadata: Use the get_metadata() and ls() functions to understand the structure of the database before performing operations.\n\n9. Limitations: Be aware of the limitations of each function. For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4.

Table Names: Always use the full table name including the '.tbl' extension when using the read_db() function.\n\n2. Function Chaining: Use the execute_operations() function to chain multiple operations together. This is particularly useful for complex queries.\n\n3. Aggregations: The aggregate() function supports basic operations like 'sum', 'mean', 'max', and 'min'. It does not support lambda functions or custom aggregations.\n\n4. Calculations: The calculate_column() function supports basic arithmetic operations but does not support complex operations like case statements.\n\n5. Conditions: When using the select() function, complex conditions (like OR conditions) are not supported. Use multiple select operations or the execute_operations() function for more complex queries.\n\n6. Joins: The merge_tables() function supports inner, outer, left, and right joins. Be mindful of the order of DataFrames for left and right joins.\n\n7. Error Handling: Many functions will raise KeyErrors if the specified table or column does not exist. Always check for the existence of tables and columns before operations.\n\n8. Metadata: Use the get_metadata() and ls() functions to understand the structure of the database before performing operations.\n\n9. Limitations: Be aware of the limitations of each function. For example, the limit() function will return all rows if the specified number exceeds the available rows.\n\nWhen answering user queries, follow these steps:\n1. Understand the query and break it down into steps.\n2. Use ls() and get_metadata() to confirm the available tables and their structures.\n3. Start with read_db() to load the necessary tables.\n4. Use select(), sort(), and limit() for basic data retrieval and filtering.\n5. Use merge_tables() if data from multiple tables is required.\n6. Use aggregate() for summary statistics.\n7. Use calculate_column() for any necessary calculations.\n8. If multiple steps are required, consider using execute_operations() to chain them together.\n9. Always check the output of each step to ensure it's producing the expected results.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 years old?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the player table\nread_db('player.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use execute_operations to chain the necessary operations\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'player.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['name', 'age', 'salary'], 'conditions': {'age': ('>', 30)}}},\n    {'function': 'sort', 'args': {'columns': 'salary', 'ascending': False}},\n    {'function': 'limit', 'args': {'n': 3}}\n])\n\nExample 2: \"What is the average annual budget for teams with more than 5 championships?\"\n\nStep 1: Read the teams table\nread_db('teams.tbl')\n\nStep 2: Use select to filter teams with more than 5 championships\nselect(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)})\n\nStep 3: Use aggregate to calculate the average annual budget\naggregate(select(read_db('teams.tbl'), columns=['team_name', 'annual_budget', 'championships'], conditions={'championships': ('>', 5)}), group_by=None, agg_dict={'annual_budget': 'mean'})\n\nExample 3: \"Who are the coaches of teams with a win percentage above 60%?\"\n\nStep 1: Calculate win percentage for each team\nexecute_operations([\n    {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n    {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n    {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n])\n\nStep 2: Merge the result with the teams and coach tables\nmerge_tables(\n    merge_tables(\n        execute_operations([\n            {'function': 'read_db', 'args': {'name': 'team_stats.tbl'}},\n            {'function': 'calculate_column', 'args': {'new_column': 'win_percentage', 'expression': 'wins / (wins + losses) * 100'}},\n            {'function': 'select', 'args': {'columns': ['team_id', 'win_percentage'], 'conditions': {'win_percentage': ('>', 60)}}}\n        ]),\n        read_db('teams.tbl'),\n        on='team_id'\n    ),\n    read_db('coach.tbl'),\n    on='team_id'\n)\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to break down complex queries into steps, use multiple functions in combination, and leverage the execute_operations function for multi-step operations.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
