Be sure to check the function descriptors for detailed information on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and observed error cases.\n\nWhen answering user queries, you can use the functions to perform tasks such as creating files and directories, listing directory contents, searching for patterns in files, modifying permissions, moving files and directories, and writing content to files.\n\nNote that some functions may throw exceptions if the input is invalid or if the operation fails. Be sure to handle these exceptions accordingly and provide useful error messages to the user.\n\nTo get started, you can call the `look_back()` function to view the command history, or use the `lay_path()` function to create a new file or directory.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it.\n\nUser Query: Create a new file called \"example.txt\" and write \"Hello, World!\" to it.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/example.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n2. Call `write_next('example.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to write the content to the file.\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory.\n\nUser Query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/directory\" directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the directory contents.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\nUser Query: Search for the pattern \"example\" in the \"example.txt\" file.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `match_it('example', 'example.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be sure to handle these exceptions accordingly and provide useful error messages to the user.\n\nTo get started, you can call the `look_back()` function to view the command history, or use the `lay_path()` function to create a new file or directory.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it.\n\nUser Query: Create a new file called \"example.txt\" and write \"Hello, World!\" to it.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/example.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n2. Call `write_next('example.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to write the content to the file.\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory.\n\nUser Query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/directory\" directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the directory contents.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\nUser Query: Search for the pattern \"example\" in the \"example.txt\" file.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `match_it('example', 'example.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be sure to handle these exceptions accordingly and provide useful error messages to the user.\n\nTo get started, you can call the `look_back()` function to view the command history, or use the `lay_path()` function to create a new file or directory.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it.\n\nUser Query: Create a new file called \"example.txt\" and write \"Hello, World!\" to it.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/example.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n2. Call `write_next('example.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to write the content to the file.\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory.\n\nUser Query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/directory\" directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the directory contents.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\nUser Query: Search for the pattern \"example\" in the \"example.txt\" file.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `match_it('example', 'example.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be sure to check the function descriptors for detailed information on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and observed error cases.\n\nWhen answering user queries, you can use the functions to perform tasks such as creating files and directories, listing directory contents, searching for patterns in files, modifying permissions, moving files and directories, and writing content to files.\n\nNote that some functions may throw exceptions if the input is invalid or if the operation fails. Be sure to handle these exceptions accordingly and provide useful error messages to the user.\n\nTo get started, you can call the `look_back()` function to view the command history, or use the `lay_path()` function to create a new file or directory.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it.\n\nUser Query: Create a new file called \"example.txt\" and write \"Hello, World!\" to it.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/example.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n2. Call `write_next('example.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to write the content to the file.\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory.\n\nUser Query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/directory\" directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the directory contents.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\nUser Query: Search for the pattern \"example\" in the \"example.txt\" file.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `match_it('example', 'example.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Be sure to check the function descriptors for detailed information on how to use each function, including argument types, return types, and observed error cases.\n\nWhen answering user queries, you can use the functions to perform tasks such as creating files and directories, listing directory contents, searching for patterns in files, modifying permissions, moving files and directories, and writing content to files.\n\nNote that some functions may throw exceptions if the input is invalid or if the operation fails. Be sure to handle these exceptions accordingly and provide useful error messages to the user.\n\nTo get started, you can call the `look_back()` function to view the command history, or use the `lay_path()` function to create a new file or directory.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Create a new file and write content to it.\n\nUser Query: Create a new file called \"example.txt\" and write \"Hello, World!\" to it.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `lay_path('/path/to/example.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n2. Call `write_next('example.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to write the content to the file.\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory.\n\nUser Query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/directory\" directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the directory contents.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\nUser Query: Search for the pattern \"example\" in the \"example.txt\" file.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `match_it('example', 'example.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `lay_path('/path/to/example.txt', mode='file')` to create the file.\n2. Call `write_next('example.txt', 'Hello, World!')` to write the content to the file.\n\nExample 2: List the contents of a directory.\n\nUser Query: List the contents of the \"/path/to/directory\" directory.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `look_in('/path/to/directory', all=True, show_perm=True)` to list the directory contents.\n\nExample 3: Search for a pattern in a file.\n\nUser Query: Search for the pattern \"example\" in the \"example.txt\" file.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Call `match_it('example', 'example.txt')` to search for the pattern in the file.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.
