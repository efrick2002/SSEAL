Call `ls()` to list the available tables.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the list of tables.\n\nExample 2: Retrieving Database Metadata\n- User Query: \"What information is available about the database structure?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `get_metadata()` to retrieve metadata about the database.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide detailed information about the tables and their relationships.\n\nExample 3: Reading a Specific Table\n- User Query: \"Can you show me the data in the 'teams' table?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `read_db('teams.tbl')` to read the 'teams' table.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the data from the table.\n\nExample 4: Executing Multiple Operations\n- User Query: \"List the tables and provide metadata about the database.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}, {'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])`.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `ls()` to list the available tables.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the list of tables.\n\nExample 2: Retrieving Database Metadata\n- User Query: \"What information is available about the database structure?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `get_metadata()` to retrieve metadata about the database.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide detailed information about the tables and their relationships.\n\nExample 3: Reading a Specific Table\n- User Query: \"Can you show me the data in the 'teams' table?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `read_db('teams.tbl')` to read the 'teams' table.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the data from the table.\n\nExample 4: Executing Multiple Operations\n- User Query: \"List the tables and provide metadata about the database.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}, {'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])`.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `ls()` to list the available tables.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the list of tables.\n\nExample 2: Retrieving Database Metadata\n- User Query: \"What information is available about the database structure?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `get_metadata()` to retrieve metadata about the database.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide detailed information about the tables and their relationships.\n\nExample 3: Reading a Specific Table\n- User Query: \"Can you show me the data in the 'teams' table?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `read_db('teams.tbl')` to read the 'teams' table.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the data from the table.\n\nExample 4: Executing Multiple Operations\n- User Query: \"List the tables and provide metadata about the database.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}, {'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])`.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `ls()` to list the available tables.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the list of tables.\n\nExample 2: Retrieving Database Metadata\n- User Query: \"What information is available about the database structure?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `get_metadata()` to retrieve metadata about the database.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide detailed information about the tables and their relationships.\n\nExample 3: Reading a Specific Table\n- User Query: \"Can you show me the data in the 'teams' table?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `read_db('teams.tbl')` to read the 'teams' table.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the data from the table.\n\nExample 4: Executing Multiple Operations\n- User Query: \"List the tables and provide metadata about the database.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}, {'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])`.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `ls()` to list the available tables.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the list of tables.\n\nExample 2: Retrieving Database Metadata\n- User Query: \"What information is available about the database structure?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `get_metadata()` to retrieve metadata about the database.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide detailed information about the tables and their relationships.\n\nExample 3: Reading a Specific Table\n- User Query: \"Can you show me the data in the 'teams' table?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `read_db('teams.tbl')` to read the 'teams' table.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the data from the table.\n\nExample 4: Executing Multiple Operations\n- User Query: \"List the tables and provide metadata about the database.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}, {'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])`.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `ls()` to list the available tables.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the list of tables.\n\nExample 2: Retrieving Database Metadata\n- User Query: \"What information is available about the database structure?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `get_metadata()` to retrieve metadata about the database.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide detailed information about the tables and their relationships.\n\nExample 3: Reading a Specific Table\n- User Query: \"Can you show me the data in the 'teams' table?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `read_db('teams.tbl')` to read the 'teams' table.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the data from the table.\n\nExample 4: Executing Multiple Operations\n- User Query: \"List the tables and provide metadata about the database.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}, {'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])`.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `ls()` to list the available tables.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the list of tables.\n\nExample 2: Retrieving Database Metadata\n- User Query: \"What information is available about the database structure?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `get_metadata()` to retrieve metadata about the database.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide detailed information about the tables and their relationships.\n\nExample 3: Reading a Specific Table\n- User Query: \"Can you show me the data in the 'teams' table?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `read_db('teams.tbl')` to read the 'teams' table.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the data from the table.\n\nExample 4: Executing Multiple Operations\n- User Query: \"List the tables and provide metadata about the database.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}, {'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])`.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `ls()` to list the available tables.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the list of tables.\n\nExample 2: Retrieving Database Metadata\n- User Query: \"What information is available about the database structure?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `get_metadata()` to retrieve metadata about the database.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide detailed information about the tables and their relationships.\n\nExample 3: Reading a Specific Table\n- User Query: \"Can you show me the data in the 'teams' table?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `read_db('teams.tbl')` to read the 'teams' table.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the data from the table.\n\nExample 4: Executing Multiple Operations\n- User Query: \"List the tables and provide metadata about the database.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}, {'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])`.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Call `ls()` to list the available tables.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the list of tables.\n\nExample 2: Retrieving Database Metadata\n- User Query: \"What information is available about the database structure?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `get_metadata()` to retrieve metadata about the database.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide detailed information about the tables and their relationships.\n\nExample 3: Reading a Specific Table\n- User Query: \"Can you show me the data in the 'teams' table?\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `read_db('teams.tbl')` to read the 'teams' table.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide the data from the table.\n\nExample 4: Executing Multiple Operations\n- User Query: \"List the tables and provide metadata about the database.\"\n- Steps:\n  1. Call `execute_operations([{'function': 'ls', 'args': {}}, {'function': 'get_metadata', 'args': {}}])`.\n  2. Analyze the output to provide both the list of tables and the metadata.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.
