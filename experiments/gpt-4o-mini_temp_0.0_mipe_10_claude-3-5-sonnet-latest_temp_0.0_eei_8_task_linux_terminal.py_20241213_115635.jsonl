File Operations:\n- All file operations are relative to current directory\n- Parent directories must exist for file creation\n- Cannot create directories\n- File permissions don't prevent write operations\n- Unicode and special characters are fully supported\n\n2. Permission Management:\n- super() required for protected operations\n- Permissions shown in rwx format\n- Permissions don't restrict write operations\n- mod_perms requires exact 9-char string\n\n3. Pattern Matching:\n- match_it uses literal string matching (not regex)\n- Case-sensitive\n- Shows full lines containing matches\n- Empty pattern matches all lines\n\n4. Path Handling:\n- Supports . and .. navigation\n- Trailing slashes normalized\n- Multiple slashes cause errors\n- Cannot use wildcards in paths\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently\n- File operations create parent paths if needed\n- Permission errors shown in exceptions\n- Invalid inputs typically raise exceptions\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Start with look_in() to understand current state\n2. Use super() before protected operations\n3. Check operation results with view() or look_in()\n4. Use look_back() to understand command translation\n5. Handle errors by checking operation prerequisites\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of an important file\"\n```python\n# First check if source exists\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n# Create backup with timestamp\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt\", \"critical data\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\", view(\"/tmp/important.txt\"))\n# Verify backup\nview(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\")\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Find all configuration files containing 'debug'\"\n```python\n# Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"debug=true\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"debug=false\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/other.txt\", \"debug\")\n# Search for pattern\nmatch_it(\"debug\", \"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"/tmp/other.txt\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Secure sensitive files\"\n```python\n# Create sensitive file\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/sensitive.txt\", \"secret data\")\n# Elevate permissions and restrict access\nsuper()\nmod_perms(\"r--------\", \"/tmp/sensitive.txt\")\n# Verify permissions\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File Operations:\n- All file operations are relative to current directory\n- Parent directories must exist for file creation\n- Cannot create directories\n- File permissions don't prevent write operations\n- Unicode and special characters are fully supported\n\n2. Permission Management:\n- super() required for protected operations\n- Permissions shown in rwx format\n- Permissions don't restrict write operations\n- mod_perms requires exact 9-char string\n\n3. Pattern Matching:\n- match_it uses literal string matching (not regex)\n- Case-sensitive\n- Shows full lines containing matches\n- Empty pattern matches all lines\n\n4. Path Handling:\n- Supports . and .. navigation\n- Trailing slashes normalized\n- Multiple slashes cause errors\n- Cannot use wildcards in paths\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently\n- File operations create parent paths if needed\n- Permission errors shown in exceptions\n- Invalid inputs typically raise exceptions\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Start with look_in() to understand current state\n2. Use super() before protected operations\n3. Check operation results with view() or look_in()\n4. Use look_back() to understand command translation\n5. Handle errors by checking operation prerequisites\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of an important file\"\n```python\n# First check if source exists\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n# Create backup with timestamp\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt\", \"critical data\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\", view(\"/tmp/important.txt\"))\n# Verify backup\nview(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\")\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Find all configuration files containing 'debug'\"\n```python\n# Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"debug=true\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"debug=false\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/other.txt\", \"debug\")\n# Search for pattern\nmatch_it(\"debug\", \"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"/tmp/other.txt\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Secure sensitive files\"\n```python\n# Create sensitive file\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/sensitive.txt\", \"secret data\")\n# Elevate permissions and restrict access\nsuper()\nmod_perms(\"r--------\", \"/tmp/sensitive.txt\")\n# Verify permissions\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Path Handling:\n- Supports . and .. navigation\n- Trailing slashes normalized\n- Multiple slashes cause errors\n- Cannot use wildcards in paths\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently\n- File operations create parent paths if needed\n- Permission errors shown in exceptions\n- Invalid inputs typically raise exceptions\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Start with look_in() to understand current state\n2. Use super() before protected operations\n3. Check operation results with view() or look_in()\n4. Use look_back() to understand command translation\n5. Handle errors by checking operation prerequisites\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of an important file\"\n```python\n# First check if source exists\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n# Create backup with timestamp\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt\", \"critical data\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\", view(\"/tmp/important.txt\"))\n# Verify backup\nview(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\")\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Find all configuration files containing 'debug'\"\n```python\n# Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"debug=true\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"debug=false\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/other.txt\", \"debug\")\n# Search for pattern\nmatch_it(\"debug\", \"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"/tmp/other.txt\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Secure sensitive files\"\n```python\n# Create sensitive file\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/sensitive.txt\", \"secret data\")\n# Elevate permissions and restrict access\nsuper()\nmod_perms(\"r--------\", \"/tmp/sensitive.txt\")\n# Verify permissions\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently\n- File operations create parent paths if needed\n- Permission errors shown in exceptions\n- Invalid inputs typically raise exceptions\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Start with look_in() to understand current state\n2. Use super() before protected operations\n3. Check operation results with view() or look_in()\n4. Use look_back() to understand command translation\n5. Handle errors by checking operation prerequisites\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of an important file\"\n```python\n# First check if source exists\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n# Create backup with timestamp\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt\", \"critical data\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\", view(\"/tmp/important.txt\"))\n# Verify backup\nview(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\")\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Find all configuration files containing 'debug'\"\n```python\n# Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"debug=true\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"debug=false\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/other.txt\", \"debug\")\n# Search for pattern\nmatch_it(\"debug\", \"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"/tmp/other.txt\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Secure sensitive files\"\n```python\n# Create sensitive file\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/sensitive.txt\", \"secret data\")\n# Elevate permissions and restrict access\nsuper()\nmod_perms(\"r--------\", \"/tmp/sensitive.txt\")\n# Verify permissions\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File Operations:\n- All file operations are relative to current directory\n- Parent directories must exist for file creation\n- Cannot create directories\n- File permissions don't prevent write operations\n- Unicode and special characters are fully supported\n\n2. Permission Management:\n- super() required for protected operations\n- Permissions shown in rwx format\n- Permissions don't restrict write operations\n- mod_perms requires exact 9-char string\n\n3. Pattern Matching:\n- match_it uses literal string matching (not regex)\n- Case-sensitive\n- Shows full lines containing matches\n- Empty pattern matches all lines\n\n4. Path Handling:\n- Supports . and .. navigation\n- Trailing slashes normalized\n- Multiple slashes cause errors\n- Cannot use wildcards in paths\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently\n- File operations create parent paths if needed\n- Permission errors shown in exceptions\n- Invalid inputs typically raise exceptions\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Start with look_in() to understand current state\n2. Use super() before protected operations\n3. Check operation results with view() or look_in()\n4. Use look_back() to understand command translation\n5. Handle errors by checking operation prerequisites\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of an important file\"\n```python\n# First check if source exists\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n# Create backup with timestamp\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt\", \"critical data\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\", view(\"/tmp/important.txt\"))\n# Verify backup\nview(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\")\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Find all configuration files containing 'debug'\"\n```python\n# Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"debug=true\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"debug=false\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/other.txt\", \"debug\")\n# Search for pattern\nmatch_it(\"debug\", \"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"/tmp/other.txt\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Secure sensitive files\"\n```python\n# Create sensitive file\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/sensitive.txt\", \"secret data\")\n# Elevate permissions and restrict access\nsuper()\nmod_perms(\"r--------\", \"/tmp/sensitive.txt\")\n# Verify permissions\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

Pattern Matching:\n- match_it uses literal string matching (not regex)\n- Case-sensitive\n- Shows full lines containing matches\n- Empty pattern matches all lines\n\n4. Path Handling:\n- Supports . and .. navigation\n- Trailing slashes normalized\n- Multiple slashes cause errors\n- Cannot use wildcards in paths\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently\n- File operations create parent paths if needed\n- Permission errors shown in exceptions\n- Invalid inputs typically raise exceptions\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Start with look_in() to understand current state\n2. Use super() before protected operations\n3. Check operation results with view() or look_in()\n4. Use look_back() to understand command translation\n5. Handle errors by checking operation prerequisites\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of an important file\"\n```python\n# First check if source exists\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n# Create backup with timestamp\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt\", \"critical data\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\", view(\"/tmp/important.txt\"))\n# Verify backup\nview(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\")\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Find all configuration files containing 'debug'\"\n```python\n# Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"debug=true\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"debug=false\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/other.txt\", \"debug\")\n# Search for pattern\nmatch_it(\"debug\", \"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"/tmp/other.txt\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Secure sensitive files\"\n```python\n# Create sensitive file\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/sensitive.txt\", \"secret data\")\n# Elevate permissions and restrict access\nsuper()\nmod_perms(\"r--------\", \"/tmp/sensitive.txt\")\n# Verify permissions\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

File Operations:\n- All file operations are relative to current directory\n- Parent directories must exist for file creation\n- Cannot create directories\n- File permissions don't prevent write operations\n- Unicode and special characters are fully supported\n\n2. Permission Management:\n- super() required for protected operations\n- Permissions shown in rwx format\n- Permissions don't restrict write operations\n- mod_perms requires exact 9-char string\n\n3. Pattern Matching:\n- match_it uses literal string matching (not regex)\n- Case-sensitive\n- Shows full lines containing matches\n- Empty pattern matches all lines\n\n4. Path Handling:\n- Supports . and .. navigation\n- Trailing slashes normalized\n- Multiple slashes cause errors\n- Cannot use wildcards in paths\n\n5. Error Handling:\n- Most operations fail silently\n- File operations create parent paths if needed\n- Permission errors shown in exceptions\n- Invalid inputs typically raise exceptions\n\nWhen handling user queries:\n1. Start with look_in() to understand current state\n2. Use super() before protected operations\n3. Check operation results with view() or look_in()\n4. Use look_back() to understand command translation\n5. Handle errors by checking operation prerequisites\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"Create a backup of an important file\"\n```python\n# First check if source exists\nlook_in(\"/tmp\")\n# Create backup with timestamp\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt\", \"critical data\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\", view(\"/tmp/important.txt\"))\n# Verify backup\nview(\"/tmp/important.txt.bak\")\n```\n\nExample 2: \"Find all configuration files containing 'debug'\"\n```python\n# Create test files\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"debug=true\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"debug=false\")\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/other.txt\", \"debug\")\n# Search for pattern\nmatch_it(\"debug\", \"/tmp/config1.txt\", \"/tmp/config2.txt\", \"/tmp/other.txt\")\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Secure sensitive files\"\n```python\n# Create sensitive file\nwrite_over(\"/tmp/sensitive.txt\", \"secret data\")\n# Elevate permissions and restrict access\nsuper()\nmod_perms(\"r--------\", \"/tmp/sensitive.txt\")\n# Verify permissions\nlook_in(\"/tmp\", all=True, show_perm=True)\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
