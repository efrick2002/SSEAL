Function Discovery Process:\n   - Start with basic calls using valid IDs (1-5 for locations, 1-7 for foods, known user IDs)\n   - Test error cases to understand input validation\n   - Try different data types to understand type restrictions\n   - For listing functions (c,x,z), test different sort parameters\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User data is connected across b,j,m,n,v functions\n   - Location data is connected across e,g,q,r,w functions\n   - Food data is connected across c,h,t,u functions\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - All ID-based functions require valid numeric IDs\n   - Invalid IDs produce consistent error messages\n   - Sort parameters accept invalid inputs without errors\n\n4. System Limitations:\n   - Fixed set of valid user IDs: 1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43\n   - Fixed set of valid location IDs: 1-5\n   - Fixed set of valid food IDs: 1-7\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Alice's ID (known to be 1)\n2. Get food preferences:\n```python\nfood_ids = m(1)  # Returns [1, 2, 3]\nt(food_ids[0])   # \"Pizza\"\nt(food_ids[1])   # \"Chocolate\"\nt(food_ids[2])   # \"Sushi\"\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the current weather and time in all cities?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get list of locations:\n```python\nlocations = x(\"name\")  # Get sorted list\nfor loc in locations:\n    loc_id = loc['id']\n    weather = q(loc_id)\n    time = e(loc_id)\n    city = w(loc_id)\n    # Combine information\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Which foods are safe for someone with dairy allergies?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get all foods and check allergens:\n```python\nfoods = c(\"name\")\nfor food in foods:\n    allergens = u(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergens:\n        # Food is safe\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Discovery Process:\n   - Start with basic calls using valid IDs (1-5 for locations, 1-7 for foods, known user IDs)\n   - Test error cases to understand input validation\n   - Try different data types to understand type restrictions\n   - For listing functions (c,x,z), test different sort parameters\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User data is connected across b,j,m,n,v functions\n   - Location data is connected across e,g,q,r,w functions\n   - Food data is connected across c,h,t,u functions\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - All ID-based functions require valid numeric IDs\n   - Invalid IDs produce consistent error messages\n   - Sort parameters accept invalid inputs without errors\n\n4. System Limitations:\n   - Fixed set of valid user IDs: 1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43\n   - Fixed set of valid location IDs: 1-5\n   - Fixed set of valid food IDs: 1-7\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Alice's ID (known to be 1)\n2. Get food preferences:\n```python\nfood_ids = m(1)  # Returns [1, 2, 3]\nt(food_ids[0])   # \"Pizza\"\nt(food_ids[1])   # \"Chocolate\"\nt(food_ids[2])   # \"Sushi\"\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the current weather and time in all cities?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get list of locations:\n```python\nlocations = x(\"name\")  # Get sorted list\nfor loc in locations:\n    loc_id = loc['id']\n    weather = q(loc_id)\n    time = e(loc_id)\n    city = w(loc_id)\n    # Combine information\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Which foods are safe for someone with dairy allergies?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get all foods and check allergens:\n```python\nfoods = c(\"name\")\nfor food in foods:\n    allergens = u(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergens:\n        # Food is safe\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Function Discovery Process:\n   - Start with basic calls using valid IDs (1-5 for locations, 1-7 for foods, known user IDs)\n   - Test error cases to understand input validation\n   - Try different data types to understand type restrictions\n   - For listing functions (c,x,z), test different sort parameters\n\n2. Data Relationships:\n   - User data is connected across b,j,m,n,v functions\n   - Location data is connected across e,g,q,r,w functions\n   - Food data is connected across c,h,t,u functions\n\n3. Error Handling:\n   - All ID-based functions require valid numeric IDs\n   - Invalid IDs produce consistent error messages\n   - Sort parameters accept invalid inputs without errors\n\n4. System Limitations:\n   - Fixed set of valid user IDs: 1, 21, 35, 41, 42, 43\n   - Fixed set of valid location IDs: 1-5\n   - Fixed set of valid food IDs: 1-7\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: \"What are Alice's favorite foods?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get Alice's ID (known to be 1)\n2. Get food preferences:\n```python\nfood_ids = m(1)  # Returns [1, 2, 3]\nt(food_ids[0])   # \"Pizza\"\nt(food_ids[1])   # \"Chocolate\"\nt(food_ids[2])   # \"Sushi\"\n```\n\nExample 2: \"What's the current weather and time in all cities?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get list of locations:\n```python\nlocations = x(\"name\")  # Get sorted list\nfor loc in locations:\n    loc_id = loc['id']\n    weather = q(loc_id)\n    time = e(loc_id)\n    city = w(loc_id)\n    # Combine information\n```\n\nExample 3: \"Which foods are safe for someone with dairy allergies?\"\nSteps:\n1. Get all foods and check allergens:\n```python\nfoods = c(\"name\")\nfor food in foods:\n    allergens = u(food['id'])\n    if 'Dairy' not in allergens:\n        # Food is safe\n```\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
