Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Database Exploration\n   - Always start by using ls() to see available tables\n   - Use get_metadata() to understand table structures and relationships\n   - Verify table contents with read_db() before complex operations\n\n2. Data Manipulation Strategies\n   - Use read_db() to load tables\n   - Apply select() for filtering\n   - Use merge_tables() to combine related tables\n   - Leverage aggregate() for statistical summaries\n   - Use calculate_column() for simple mathematical derivations\n\n3. Key Limitations\n   - No complex conditional column creation\n   - Limited boolean logic in expressions\n   - Careful with multi-condition filtering\n   - Be aware of potential merge and comparison errors\n\n4. Recommended Workflow\n   - Always validate table contents first\n   - Break complex queries into multiple steps\n   - Use execute_operations() for chained transformations\n   - Handle errors gracefully by checking intermediate results\n\n5. Performance Considerations\n   - Limit large datasets when exploring\n   - Use select() and limit() to manage data volume\n   - Combine operations efficiently\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- If an operation fails, simplify the query\n- Check column names and data types\n- Verify merge keys and condition formats\n- Use execute_operations() to chain simple steps\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Player Performance Analysis\nUser Query: \"Find the top 3 highest-paid players over 30 with their performance statistics\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read player table\n```python\nplayers = read_db('player.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Select players over 30 with high salary\n```python\nhigh_paid_veterans = select(players, \n    conditions={\n        'age': ('>', 30),\n        'salary': ('>', 40000000)\n    }\n)\n```\n\n3. Merge with player statistics\n```python\nplayer_performance = merge_tables(\n    high_paid_veterans, \n    read_db('player_states.tbl'), \n    on='player_id'\n)\n```\n\n4. Sort by salary and limit\n```python\ntop_performers = sort(\n    player_performance, \n    columns='salary', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_3 = limit(top_performers, n=3)\n```\n\nExample 2: Team Efficiency Analysis\nUser Query: \"Compare team budgets and championships, identifying most efficient teams\"\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. Read teams table\n```python\nteams = read_db('teams.tbl')\n```\n\n2. Calculate budget efficiency\n```python\nefficient_teams = calculate_column(\n    teams, \n    new_column='championships_per_million', \n    expression='championships / (annual_budget / 1000000)'\n)\n```\n\n3. Sort and select top teams\n```python\nsorted_teams = sort(\n    efficient_teams, \n    columns='championships_per_million', \n    ascending=False\n)\ntop_efficient_teams = limit(sorted_teams, n=3)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate systematic problem-solving using the function environment, breaking down complex queries into manageable steps.\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
