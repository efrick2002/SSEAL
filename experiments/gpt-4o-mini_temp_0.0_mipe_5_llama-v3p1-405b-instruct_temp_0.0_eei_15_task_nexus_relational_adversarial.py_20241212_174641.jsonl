additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call.

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "

additional information regarding the evironment and how to interact and use functions, use this to guide your query answering process:\n\n        <additional_information>\n        \nTo operate the environment, you can call the functions listed above with the specified arguments. The functions will return the corresponding results or error messages.\n\nWhen calling the functions, make sure to pass the correct data types and formats. For example, when calling the `b` function, you should pass an integer as the user ID.\n\nSome functions, such as `i` and `k`, do not take any arguments and will return a constant value or a list of numbers, respectively.\n\nOther functions, such as `c` and `x`, take a string or a list of integers as input and will return a list of food items or location objects, respectively.\n\nWhen calling the functions, you may encounter error messages if the input is invalid or if the requested data does not exist. For example, if you call the `b` function with a user ID that does not exist, you will receive an error message.\n\nTo answer user queries, you can call the functions in a specific order to retrieve the necessary information. For example, if a user asks for the favorite food of a specific user, you can call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods, and then call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object.\n\nMake sure to carefully read the function descriptions and examples to understand how to use each function correctly.\n\n        </additional_information>\n\n        Here are some additional examples:\n\n        <examples>\n        \nExample 1: Get the favorite food of a specific user\n\n* Call the `m` function with the user ID to retrieve the list of favorite foods: `m(1)` -> `[1, 2, 3]`\n* Call the `h` function with the food ID to retrieve the food object: `h(1)` -> `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza', ...}`\n\nExample 2: Get the weather of a specific location\n\n* Call the `q` function with the location ID to retrieve the weather: `q(1)` -> `'Partly Cloudy, Temperature: 68\u00b0F'`\n\nExample 3: Get the list of users who like a specific food\n\n* Call the `c` function with the food name to retrieve the list of food items: `c(\"pizza\")` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pizza'}, ...]`\n* Call the `z` function with the list of user IDs to retrieve the list of user objects: `z([1, 2, 3])` -> `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, ...]`\n\n        </examples>\n        \n        Once you recieve the query, think step by step to determine which function(s) to call. Output the function(s) you would like to call seperated by newlines, all in between the <function_list> and </function_list> tags. \n        \n        Like this example:\n\n        <function_list>\n        f(1)\n        g()\n        h(4, 'a')\n        </function_list>\n\n        After providing a list of functions to call, the environment will execute these functions and you will recieve the outputs from the function calls as a list of dictionaries of the function calls and their corresponding results.\n\n        "
