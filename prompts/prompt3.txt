Now that you have explored the functions and observed their behavior, your job is to rewrite the function descriptors to better reflect their actual behavior. 
Please structure your outputs as follows:

<previous context>
   {{FUNCTIONS}}
</previous context>
<new context>
   Modify the previous context, specifically with docstrings and argument types and return types
</new context>
